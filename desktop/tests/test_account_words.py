"""Signing in, signing up and leaving, in words that say what went wrong (0.15 rows 14, 20, 36).

Sign-in said "Check the required fields, dates, times and lengths" for an empty password, a short
one and a mistyped username alike, and "Your changes may not have been saved" when the server was
gone. Sign-up repeated the hint already on screen for an empty password, so nothing seemed to
happen. Log out and Delete account went ahead on one click.
