"""The layouts a student can pick, and what each lets them change.

A layout is a whole way of showing the week, where a look is only paint. There are two roles. A main
view is where planning happens, so it has to offer the whole week, what has no time yet, Add, Plan and
opening a block by itself. A day screen is what you watch once planning is done, so it offers what is
on now, Done, Start focus, Running late and the way back.

Customising comes in three levels, and the dialog is built from this table rather than by hand:
  1. pick   which main view and which day screen
  2. style  each design's colourways, one of which always follows the student's own look
  3. detail what that design shows and how densely

This module is plain data with no Qt in it, so the choices can be checked without a screen.
