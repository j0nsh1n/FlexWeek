"""What the pointer is doing: one gesture engine for every design's hours, chips and month.

Anything a student can pick up calls `Hand.press` with what it holds. From then on the hand follows
the pointer itself: it waits for a real drag, finds the hours under the pointer, snaps, asks the
window's rule, shows the result in place, scrolls a scroll area after the pointer rests at its
edge, and on release reports one change. Moves arrive through Qt's implicit grab (the widget pressed
keeps receiving the mouse until release), so no system drag-and-drop is involved and X11 and
Wayland behave alike.

A press that never becomes a drag is a tap, handed back to whoever pressed. Escape lets go.

What a block can land on is a surface: any widget that sets `takes_blocks` and answers `track_at`
with a `Track` under a point of its own. `HoursCanvas` is one; My day's dial and anything a design
draws itself can be others. The hand asks nothing else of them, so a design brings tracks and paint,
never its own rules for dragging.
