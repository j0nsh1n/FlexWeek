"""Hours a student can drag on, drawn any way a design likes.

An `HoursCanvas` is one painted widget holding one or more tracks: a day's column, seven columns, a
lane per day, a card laid at an angle. It draws the week's blocks on them through a `BlockPainter`,
which is the only thing a design replaces to look like itself, and passes every press to the window's
`Hand`, which owns the gestures. While something is held, the canvas draws it where it would land,
with its times written on it.

The canvas also answers the rig and the tests in global coordinates: where a day and minute are,
where a block is drawn, and how to bring a stretch of hours into view.
