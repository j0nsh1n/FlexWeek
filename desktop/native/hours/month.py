"""Month, as Daily Scheduler draws it, and one thing more: a block can be carried to another date.

Daily Scheduler's month is one painted grid. Each date shows its day number and its events as chips
that start with their time ("09:00 History essay"); what does not fit becomes "+N more"; a click
anywhere on a date opens that day. FlexWeek draws the same, in weeks that start on Monday, with the
homework due that day as "Due" chips first.

A chip with a time can also be carried: it is picked up by the one `Hand` as a date move, the hand
asks the window whether the block can go on the date under the pointer, and the date shows the
answer while the chip is held. Letting go reports a `MoveDate`; the window saves it. A deadline chip
is not carried: moving a deadline is editing the homework.

Today's app and every design show this grid through `MonthGrid`; a design dresses it with its
colour tokens.
