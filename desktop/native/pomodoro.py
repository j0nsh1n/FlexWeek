"""Splitting a placed block into focus chunks and breaks.

"Split long homework into focus sessions" was a checkbox the desktop could set and never acted on:
the whole feature lived in the web client. This is that feature, ported, and kept in step with
pomodoroPlan, buildPomodoroBlocks, solveInputBlocks and autoSplitSolvedBlocks in the retired web client.

Two things happen around a solve. Before it, each long flexible block asks for the time its breaks
will need as well, so the solver leaves room for them. After it, each placed block is replaced by its
chunks. Doing only the first would reserve time nothing uses; doing only the second would lay breaks
over whatever the solver put next.

No Qt and no network in here, so the arithmetic can be checked on its own.
