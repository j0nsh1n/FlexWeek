"""One reading of the week, shared by every layout.

The week table works out where a block sits inside its own set_week. Seven more views each doing that
would be seven chances to disagree about what is on Thursday, so the rules live here once: a solver
placement wins unless the block is finished, a finished session stays on the day it was finished, and
flexible work with no start is waiting for a time. Risk is the solver's own verdict from the trace,
never a threshold invented by a view.
