"""Drive FlexWeek with a real pointer on a hidden desktop, and check that the saved week agrees.

    .venv/bin/python scripts/rig/drive.py                       # every design, every tab
    .venv/bin/python scripts/rig/drive.py --design bento --tab day
    .venv/bin/python scripts/rig/drive.py --list

Every scenario starts from the same seeded week with the clock held at Thursday 15:40. It opens its
tab with the pointer, performs one gesture with xdotool on the hidden session's X display, waits for
the save, reloads the week from the server and asserts on what came back. A screenshot is taken
while the pointer is still held and another after the drop, and each design's run is recorded as a
video with the pointer drawn in. Results land in /tmp/flexweek-rig/<run>/.

Surfaces are found through the hours interface below, which every hours surface provides. A surface
that has no hours fails the scenarios that need them, which is what the 0.14.3 baseline records.
