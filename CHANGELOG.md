# Changelog

All notable changes to FlexWeek are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.19.1] - 2026-10-10

### Fixed
- Add fixed time opens at once: the dimmed window and the sheet appear together. Before, the window dimmed first and the sheet followed a moment later. The same goes for adding one from the add menu, Ctrl+K, a free spot's menu and a range drawn on the hours.
- With Large text, the window fits a 1366x768 laptop screen in every design again. In Retro it could not get shorter than 782 px after signing in.
- Month fits a 1024x640 window with "Unfinished homework from earlier weeks" open, with no scroll bar and the last week whole.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-10-10

### Added
- Before the week grid there is a list of this week's blocks for screen readers and keyboard users. It stays folded until the keyboard reaches it (Tab, or Ctrl+Shift+L), so it takes no room on the page.

### Changed
- School and your Setup activities now stand in every week, so next week has school and Plan keeps homework out of it. Before, next week had none. Removing one asks "Just this week" or "Every week".
- Plan gives work due after this Sunday a fair share of this week, and its details say how much is left for next week, such as "Science project: 1 h this week, 1 h left for next week." The earliest work is still placed first.
- Choosing a time, Do it at, or dropping a block onto a time that has already passed is refused with "That's in the past." A block already under way can still be lengthened.
- Choosing a time on an empty week says "No time left this week. Choose a day in next week." instead of a generic message.
- Plan's Undo message stays up while the pointer or the keyboard is on it, and shows how long is left. A second Plan with nothing new no longer replaces it. After Plan, the keyboard goes to the week.
- Text size is your own setting in every look. Large text stays Large when you pass through High contrast, Terminal or another look, and after a restart. High contrast now suggests Large with a Use button instead of switching it.
- Restore points keep the standing week. Restoring one brings back the School and activity times that stood when it was made; points from before 0.19.0 leave the current times as they are.
- Wording is plainer: the Priority field is now Type (Test prep, Quiz prep, Everyday homework, Reading), a pinned time reads "Pinned to Thu at 5:00 PM. Plan won't move it." with an Unpin button, and Export and Import account are now Export and Import backup file.
- Segmented choices, such as the look picker and "Let FlexWeek pick a time" in Add homework, are radio buttons for screen readers. Each group is one Tab stop; arrow keys, Home and End move and choose, and a focus ring shows the group.
- Account and recovery errors sit beside their fields, the field that needs attention gets focus, and a screen reader announces the message at once.
- Linux: the download and the AppImage include libxkbcommon and libxkbcommon-x11, so the window opens on desktops that lack them.
- AppImage: if libEGL is missing, FlexWeek stops with one line that names the library and the install command for Ubuntu, Mint, Debian and Fedora, instead of the loader's error. It starts when it cannot read the library list.
- If PySide6 or the engine fails to load, FlexWeek shows one plain message instead of a Python traceback. On Windows the message appears in a message box.

### Fixed
- Homework left unfinished in an earlier week now shows in More > Unfinished ("1 left") and after Plan, as "N unfinished from last week" with "Plan them" and "I did these". Before, it read "None left" and Plan said everything had a time.
- Quit and closing the window save unsaved changes first. If a save fails, FlexWeek stays open and says so.
- Focus minutes earned while a save is under way are kept. Before, the save could replace them and they were lost.
- Changing the timer length during a focus session no longer changes that session's credit or its progress ring. The change applies to the next work phase.
- A setting that failed to save, such as while offline, is sent again when Settings closes. Before, it was taken for saved and the old value came back on the next start.
- A restore point named the same as an earlier one in the same sitting now saves the week as it is now. Before, it returned the old point, so a later restore brought back the old week.
- Importing a changed version of a week file gives the changed homework its own entry instead of attaching it to the old one. Importing homework that is new to the account saves.
- A block whose length is not whole quarter hours, such as 17 minutes, stays a block. Before, it became homework that the app then refused at start-up, and account export failed.
- Signing in with an old password while it is being reset or changed no longer opens a session after everyone else was signed out.
- A file that is not a FlexWeek export is refused with a message that says it is not recognized. Before, the import failed with no message.
- Downloaded updates are deleted once they are installed or fail to install. Before, each one stayed in the temp folder, and hundreds of megabytes could pile up.
- Control edges and focused fields have enough contrast in every look, and a focused field no longer grows by 2 px.
- In Retro, segmented choices keep their raised look. "Please sign in again" after a session ends shows under the form, not on the Username box.
- The sign-in card keeps keyboard focus when it measures itself, and Skip setup puts a 24-hour clock you tried back on the Week step.

## [0.18.5] - 2026-10-10

### Added
- Setup's "Your week" page asks for a 12-hour or 24-hour clock. New accounts start on 12-hour; accounts made before this keep 24-hour.
- The Day dial names its arcs: a block's name runs along its arc, free time still ahead reads "Free until 22:00", and free time already gone reads "Earlier today". A "Reading the ring" key sits above the list. Words too long for their arc are left off.
- The plan list adds a line for each day whose homework adds up to more than 3 hours, such as "Thursday has 5 h 30 min of homework.", and opens by itself when it has one. The plan still places the earliest work first.

### Changed
- Dates are written one way across the app. Short is "Thu 1 Oct" and long is "Thursday 1 October"; the year shows only when it is not this year, as in "28 Dec – 3 Jan 2027". Week-grid column heads are unchanged.
- The look editor's Start from is a grid of look pictures, with your own look last, instead of a drop-down. Arrow keys move between them, Enter chooses and Esc keeps the look you had.
- The sign-in pages have one "Sign in" heading, a card in the same place on all three pages, hints under their fields, and a clearer password eye. With nobody signed in the window wears this computer's own look, and the card's shadow is no longer cut off.
- Block icons are 16 px and read better on their blocks in the hours, Clay and Mission. School's block shows a school building, and "Replan all my homework" has its own calendar icon.
- Every design's hours end with a label at the bottom: "24:00", or "12:00 AM" on the 12-hour clock. Today's app used to leave it off.
- One thing's empty state has a quiet ring, "Free until 22:00" in the centre before 22:00, and a labelled day bar with hour marks and "Now" over the current time.
- Moving between Week or Day and Month or My day slides the page sideways, as Retro's Month does. The title changes at once. Month's rows shrink to fit while the plan or Unfinished panel is open, so the last row is no longer cut off.
- Month keeps the last month on screen while the next one loads. Motion "Off" stops every motion, including Settings' section changes, and "More" is slower: its standard ease takes 450 ms, against Normal's 180 ms.
- The Undo message stays when you switch between Day, Week, Month, My day or a design. It goes when the week changes, when it times out, or when you use it.
- Settings' Hide, Preview and Save restore point are outlined buttons. Close stays plain, and Restore stays the one filled button.
- A keyboard-focused button in the top bar or a view switch gets a 2 px accent ring with a gap, in every look.
- Placeholder text in fields, and the look editor's Changed chip, are darker or lighter so they read on their backgrounds. The look editor's warnings are reworded, and its Fix aims at the hardest check first.
- Month's done and held chips keep their words at full strength; only the fill is lighter.
- Homework's red dots and bar on the rail are lighter in the dark looks, so they read on dark cards.
- After a zoom stops at the smallest or largest level, a line under the zoom buttons says so for 3 seconds. The zoom buttons have larger click areas.
- Clay names a block too short or too narrow for its own words, beside it, over it or by its start time. Side cards keep their size.
- Empty Saturdays and Sundays are narrower in Retro, Bento and Timeline, as they already were in Today's app, so weekday names are no longer cut.
- Paper and Ink cards have a warm edge, and timer digits keep a steady width.
- "Look" is the name of Settings' first section and of the command bar's entry, and the editor is "Edit look…". "Study times" is now "Study hours". Retro's description reads "a retro desktop window".
- The README has a numbered first-run section, a contributors list (j0nsh1n and maruzenskymambo for ideas), and an AI disclosure that names every assistant that helped.

### Fixed
- The keyboard's place on the week follows the pointer. A click on the hours moves it to the slot or block pressed and hides the ring; closing the sheet that click opened leaves it there, so Shift+F10 asks about what was clicked, and a block saved from a sheet gets the keyboard. Only that block shows as chosen. In Today's app, Timeline, Mission, Bento and Retro.
- Buttons no longer cut their words ("Accept late start" read "ccept late sta"). Every button in a sheet and in the top bar is at least its words plus 20 px at each side and 36 px tall (40 at Large text), and buttons measure again when the text size or the look changes while a sheet or Settings is open. Running late's answers go under Preview when the row has no room, and This computer's three buttons are no longer a fixed width. At Large text the top bar keeps one row in a
  window about 1190 px wide or more, and goes to two rows below that.
- The block editor's End follows Start only once Start is settled (Enter, Tab or leaving the box), not on each key, and never after End was typed in that sheet. It stops at 24:00 instead of wrapping to the morning, and says "End moved to 17:30" (screen readers hear it). The End-before-Start message now reads "End needs to be later than Start (16:00)." in every sheet that shows it.
- Time boxes: the first click into one selects the whole time, as Tab does, and Ctrl+A selects the whole text. Enter keeps a typed time in every time zone; it moved by the computer's UTC offset before. A time that cannot be read stays in the box with a red outline, a warning icon and "Type a time like 17:30." (or "5:30 PM." on the 12-hour clock), which a screen reader says; it is no longer swapped for the old time. Save, Enter and Add do not
  save while a box shows that line; the keyboard goes back to the box.
- Tab leaves the Notes box in Add homework and the other multi-line boxes in sheets and Settings; Shift+Tab goes back. Tab no longer types a tab character into them.
- Setup's Tab order follows the screen: a new activity or first-homework row is reached before Next, not after it. Removing an activity keeps focus in the list and says "Activity removed" to a screen reader.
- Text size is always on screen: the first card of Settings > Look, above Colours. It is no longer hidden behind "Show shape, spacing and type".
- Plan offers every day up to a due date after this Sunday, weekend included, not only Monday to Friday.
- Screen readers name each field in the homework, event and Setup forms by its label, not by its current value or its hint.
- The ringing alarm's dialog shows its time on the clock you chose. It always showed 24-hour before, even on a 12-hour clock.
- A long homework name stays whole in the Focus list on the 12-hour clock; the time moves to its own line under it.
- The bar that appears after Plan is placed under the top bar and slides down into view again; since
  0.18.2 an error in its layout left it where it was first drawn.

## [0.18.4] - 2026-10-09

### Changed
- Motion is smoother. Pages, views, sheets and slides move as still pictures
  on a clock that follows the screen's refresh rate, so fast displays keep
  up. Typing or clicking in a sheet while it fades shows the sheet at once.
- A sheet's dim starts at the click. The sheet is built behind the dim, so
  the window darkens at once instead of after the sheet is ready.
- Clay: a change of day moves each card as sharp pictures at its start and
  end sizes, with a short crossfade. The text is not stretched, no card
  doubles up on Day, and nothing jumps when the move lands.
- Retro desktop: Month slides in over the dimmed desk the way Settings does,
  and slides away when you go back. Its contents appear as soon as they load.

### Fixed
- Timeline at 1280 px wide, with the fold at 6 | 1: notes no longer run past
  the right page's edge, and the hour tracks stop short of the scroll bar.
- A sheet closed while it is still fading in is freed again.
- The hours zoom no longer reports an error during a Clay slide.

## [0.18.3] - 2026-10-08

### Added
- A style's feel reaches every page. With Night owl, Dashboard or Retro as the
  main view, Settings, the sheets, Setup and sign-in take its fonts, shapes
  and chrome: Night owl's serif headings and paper edge, Dashboard's title on
  a coloured tile with rounder cards, Retro's pixel type, bevels and Windows
  98 title bars. Setup shows each style's feel as it is picked, and sign-in
  wears the style this computer used last. Plain calendar and the other
  designs look as before, and the week and day pages keep their own design.
- Timeline's fold moves: drag the "‹ 3 | 4 ›" handle in the day-name row,
  click its arrows, or use Left and Right, from 1 | 6 to 6 | 1. It is also in
  Settings as "Days on the left page", and the page footers reflow to fit.
- Protected time can have a name, up to 40 characters ("e.g. Piano"), which
  its chip shows.
- Clay: a sideways drag on a neighbouring day or the space between the cards
  moves to that day.
- Manage account's password boxes have the show-password eye.

### Changed
- Study hours are one list. Preferred study hours and planning hours are
  merged into Study hours, set in Setup and in Availability; hours saved the
  old way are carried into it.
- Availability shows the week as a strip, then Study hours, Protected and
  Cut-off as tabs, one row of chips per day with a + to add.
- Setup's Style page shows one style at a time, large, with the neighbours
  dimmed at the sides; Plain calendar is chosen and previewed from the start.
  Every Setup page's column starts at the same place, and the pages fade
  under the footer instead of being cut by it.
- Settings: the worn look is marked inside its card ("Wearing"), the look and
  design grids stretch to the row, controls on Focus, Alerts and This
  computer share one width and one label column, the timer preset comes
  first on Focus, and sections fade under a floating footer.
- Add and Edit homework: due starts tomorrow; the multiple-of-15 hint shows
  only for a wrong length; Edit says where the homework is placed; "In one go"
  or "Spread over days" from 60 minutes up, and Save with Spread writes the
  spread times straight away.
- The sheets: the plan panel says "Placed"; Choose a time picks one day and a
  length; "New event" is "Add fixed time", with its Spotify link under More
  details; Running late is greyed on another week ("Open this week to use
  Running late."); Help, Routines, About and School hours are tidied.
- The focus screen: the ring is the accent before Start; Skip and Finish sit
  beside Pause; Finish asks "End this session?"; the buttons no longer move
  the ring when they change.
- Clay's neighbouring days are dimmed and stay still while the front day
  scrolls.
- At Large text, homework names in the rail and the focus list wrap onto two
  lines before they are cut, and the week's date keeps 16 px from the view
  switcher.
- A wrong password shows as a red line under the password box, with a link
  explaining why.

### Fixed
- The rail's focus list shows all its rows instead of a small scrolling box.
- At Large text the top bar could leave Plan on a second row until the next
  change.

## [0.18.2] - 2026-10-04

### Added
- An empty week shows a card over the hours offering "Copy last week's fixed
  times" and "Use a routine". The hours round it can still be clicked and
  dragged on, and the card goes once something is added. An empty Routines
  list says "No routines saved yet."
- F1 opens Help and Ctrl+N opens Add homework from the week. Both are listed
  in Help and in Ctrl+K.
- Ctrl+K lists Alerts, This computer and Choose a time…. Choose a time with
  nothing waiting says "All your homework already has a time."
- Plan gives two new reasons. A deadline that has already passed says "That
  time has already passed.", and homework due today with no study time left
  says "Due today and no study time is left today."
- The alarm list in Settings › Alerts shows which alarm has the keyboard and
  which is selected.

### Changed
- A short block shows its name, then its start, in every design. A time range
  stays on one line ("08:30–14:15", "8:30 AM–2:15 PM"), the title is cut
  before the time, and a length reads "2h 15m" at every width.
- The line for now runs on under a block's words and icon instead of stopping
  short of them.
- Timeline writes a deadline as "due Sun 4 Oct" and a placed block as "placed
  Fri 15:30". Unfinished lists only homework whose deadline has passed, and is
  greyed when there is none. After its first showing in a session the
  Unfinished card folds into a one-line badge that opens it again.
- Mission control keeps a block's bar and icon down to 8 px wide, the title
  cut first, and draws a tick only below that.
- "Planned" means placed homework time in every design. Bento says "Nothing
  free now" after the last study hour, Clay's "Free until" leaves out
  everything still ahead, and lines that said the same thing twice say it
  once.
- While a timer runs, Today's app shows the one-line strip the other designs
  show ("Session · 29:42 left · Focus screen").
- The block menu and the free-time menu are the same width and style. The
  block menu has Copy and one Delete, which for homework with more than one
  time asks whether to delete this time or the whole homework.
- Below 1100 px wide, "Not placed yet · 1" is a chip with the book icon and a
  chevron. A click opens the homework waiting for a time on a row under it,
  ready to drag onto the hours, and no longer widens the window.
- The top bar shortens in one order at every width and text size: the date,
  then More to its icon, then "Plan my homework" to "Plan homework", then
  "Plan".
- Plan's review panel slides in over the week, drawn whole, instead of popping
  in and pushing the week down.
- Settings opens without a pause: the page stays built between opens and
  shows what the signed-in account holds.
- Offline, Plan says "Can't reach FlexWeek, so nothing was planned. Try
  again." and Save says "Not saved: FlexWeek can't be reached. Your changes
  are still here. Choose Retry save." Plan that places nothing says "Nothing
  placed. 1 still needs a time."
- About, Manage account, Create account and Sign out say the same thing about
  where the week is kept: on this computer (or the server), under this
  account.
- More's Undo is on whenever the toast offers Undo. Save, Restore and Reload
  are "Save this week now", "Copies of this week…" and "Reload this week as it
  is saved".
- A new row in Setup's "Sports, clubs and jobs" named after a common sport
  (soccer, swim, track, tennis and others) starts as Sports; anything else,
  such as "Piano practice", starts as Activity. Either can still be changed.

### Fixed
- A block dropped on a past day is refused with "That's in the past." and goes
  back. The drag ghost takes the block's colour, writes the whole name when it
  fits, and the placed block keeps its icon.
- The sign-in card's message clears when the card changes to another page.
- Homework blocks in Timeline, Mission control, Bento, Retro, Clay and One
  thing had no time line or edge, and the hours stopped painting after the
  first one.
- Add homework's past-deadline check took the date and the time of day from
  different clocks.
- Going back a week after Copy last week's fixed times could stop the app.
- Bento's now pill sat inside today's column, Mission's names beside a block
  were crossed by the line for now, Mission's 00:00 label sat 6 px left of the
  hours, Clay's Day card had no hours while it slid in, Bento's header read
  "F 2", and 12-hour times were cut in Clay's Day summary and Retro's
  deadlines at Large text and 810 px.

## [0.18.1] - 2026-10-03

### Added
- Add and Edit homework have a "When" choice under Due: "Let FlexWeek pick a
  time" or "Do it at", with a day and a time. Do it at places the homework
  there and Plan works round it; dragging a homework block on the hours does
  the same, and reopening it shows Do it at with that day and time. Choosing
  Let FlexWeek pick a time hands it back to Plan. A planned homework block has
  a dashed edge and one placed by hand a solid edge, in Today's app, Timeline
  and Mission control.
- The Week grid is one Tab stop. Inside it the arrow keys move a quarter hour
  up and down and a day left and right, onto a block when one is there. Enter
  opens the block or the free-time menu, Shift+F10 or the Menu key opens the
  menu for the slot in focus, Delete deletes the block in focus, and Esc goes
  back to the top bar. The slot or block in focus has a ring.

### Changed
- "At a set time" in Add and Edit homework is now "Due by", on the Due row,
  with "FlexWeek plans it before this time." under it. A deadline that has
  already passed is refused with "That time has already passed."
- Every time box takes typing like a text box. Typing replaces what is
  selected, Backspace clears, and "1515", "15:15", "3:15 pm" and "315p" all
  mean 15:15 on either clock. Text that is not a time puts back the time from
  before. The arrow keys and the wheel step a quarter hour.
- An End of 00:00 means the end of the day and is written 24:00 (12:00 AM on
  the 12-hour clock), in the block editor, Setup's school and activity hours,
  the School hours sheet and study hours. It was refused as "End must be after
  Start".
- New event and Choose a time open on the next quarter hour still ahead, not
  on a time that has passed. Running late starts from the next quarter hour.
- A click, a right-click and the start of a new block on the hours land on
  the nearest quarter hour, and the free-time menu names that time.
- Availability, Plan unfinished homework, the "Any colour" picker, Leave the
  look editor, Manage account, Save recovery codes and every question the app
  asks (Sign out, deleting an account, homework, an event or a look) open as
  sheets inside the window, not as separate windows. The colour picker is a
  grid of swatches with a box for a colour code. Recovery codes save to
  Documents by default, with a line to keep the file somewhere private.
- Sheets have one filled main button and an outlined Cancel. "Plan here" is a
  tinted button and "Delete" an outlined one in the Unfinished panel, both at
  least 36 px tall. A main button that cannot be pressed yet writes its words
  in the text colour and has a line under it saying why.
- Choose a time's warning that something else is at that time is a tinted row
  with a mark, not plain text.
- Duplicate, paste, copy day and apply routine no longer stop on an overlap.
  The preview shows "... is at that time too. Both will show, side by side."
  on that row and Save stays on, as a drag already did.
- A block that starts plays its own Spotify link, or the Settings link when
  the sound is Spotify. The field is "Default Spotify link". Reminders before
  a block and the end of a focus session still play Chime. A start caught a
  few minutes late still plays, for as long as the reminder lead.
- The reminder lead starts at 5 minutes everywhere; Setup used to set 10.
  "No homework after" offers the same times in Setup and in Availability.
- The app says "Sign in" and "Sign out" everywhere.

### Fixed
- Undo after Plan, when one save had changed a fixed block and homework
  together, no longer ends in "Not saved" with an empty week. If an Undo or
  Redo is refused, the saved week is loaded again and Undo is offered again.
- Plan takes one click: more clicks while it is planning do nothing.
- A notice with two lines is no longer cut at the top and bottom of its pill.
- Mission control opens with the time now in view late in the evening, and
  its focus minutes count while a session runs.
- Right-clicking free time in Week opens its menu every time; it used to miss
  when the pointer moved a few pixels between press and release.
- After Plan, Undo, Redo, leaving Focus, dropping a block or closing a sheet,
  the keyboard goes back to the week instead of the previous-week arrow.
- Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y undo the week from any box on its page that has nothing
  typed in it.
- The first and last hour on screen in Week are always labelled.
- Settings slides in smoothly. The page was painted again for every frame of
  the slide; a picture of it slides now, and the page is painted once it lands.
- Manage account no longer draws New password over Current password, and its
  delete action shows in full.
- Add homework no longer scrolls inside itself when the due time is on; the
  sheet grows to the window first, and Save and Cancel stay at its foot.
- Setup's First homework calendar draws its days, and starts on the next
  school day rather than Sunday.
- Typing a due date without a year means the next time that date comes.

### Removed
- The tests that compared the engine with the frozen copies of the original
  Python, and those copies (`desk_ref/`, `backend/tests/engine_ref/`).

## [0.18.0] - 2026-10-02

### Changed
- The planner, the day's and month's logic, storage and the desktop's logic
  that does not draw are rewritten in Rust (`engine/`, contract in
  `docs/engine/contract.md`) and built into the app as the `flexweek_engine`
  module. Nothing a student sees changes: the same plans, the same words, the
  same files. A week that took the old planner 2.9 ms to place takes about
  1 ms, and while the window is busy on its own thread, as it is in the
  running app, 1 ms where it took 8. Drawing a frame of the hours takes about
  as long as before: about 10 ms, where 0.17.2 took 9.
- An existing account opens as it is. The database keeps its format, and
  passwords, sessions and recovery codes made by earlier versions still work.
- Storage has one owner: only the engine opens the database. The server's
  routes ask it for rows instead of writing SQL themselves.
- Building from source needs Rust as well as Python (`pip install ./engine/py`;
  see the README). The downloads need nothing new.
- `fwtest` starts and stops the rig's hidden desktop itself (it was a Python
  script), and an interrupted run leaves nothing running.

### Fixed
- Minute snapping preserves Python's rounding and the 15-minute grid at large values.
- Restore previews display unusual stored titles as Python did, including `True` and `None`.
- Startup and request connections use the same database settings and treat `file:` as a literal filename.
- Theme migration stops on an unreadable column instead of silently omitting it.
- A database operation's crash keeps its original error through cleanup and rolls back pending writes.
- A homework session saved with an empty start counts as not placed yet, so its Day page opens and Month lists it as unscheduled.
- A custom look's Fix for the accent checks the calendar grid as well as the page and cards.
- A study window whose start uses digits from another script, such as Arabic-Indic, is read at its real time.
- Tests draw text the same way in every worker, so the date picker's test no
  longer fails on machines with subpixel text.
- A look saved with a category hue of exactly 0 or -360 is written as 0.0,
  not -0.0, and the update check reads a checksum file with unusual line
  breaks the way it did before the engine.
- The release workflow stops a Windows installer or smoke test that hangs
  after ten minutes instead of waiting out the runner.

## [0.17.2] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- Right-clicking free time in the hours, in Today's app and in every design,
  offers Add fixed time at that time, Add homework due that day, and Paste
  (greyed, saying why, until something is copied). Each opens its sheet with
  the day and time filled in. With the hours focused, Shift+F10 or the Menu
  key opens the same menu at the first free time of the chosen block's day,
  or today's.

### Changed
- Mission control's lanes open showing the evening: through 22:00, or the end
  of the day's last block if that is later, scrolled there rather than zoomed
  out. Names written beside a block stay inside what shows, so "History" is
  no longer cut to "Histor" at the right edge; the morning is a scroll to the
  left. The time now always shows when it is in the week or day shown: if
  the lanes cannot show both now and the evening's end, they open with now 45
  minutes from the left edge and the evening is a scroll.
- Mission control's pill for the time now no longer lies over an hour label
  when the lanes are zoomed out: the label it would cover is left out.
- Timeline fills every block with its category's colour, as the other designs
  do, in every colourway: School, Dinner and the rest were the page's colour
  in an outlined card. The ink outline and the category tab stay, and
  homework is as it was.
- Timeline's two pages meet at a fold line only: the grey shade either side of
  it is gone.
- Choose a time and Spread, which open from the homework editor, are sheets
  inside the window like the editors: centred over the dimmed week, with their
  title and a close button at the top and each label above its field. They
  were windows of their own with title bars.
- Every block carries a small picture of its category, as homework carries
  its book: a house for School, a pencil for Study, a target for Sports,
  sparkles for an Activity, a clock for Meals, a moon for Sleep. Free time
  has none. The picture is drawn in its category's own colour, darkened or
  lightened only as far as it takes to show at 3 to 1 on the block, in every
  look and block style. Where a block is too small for all three, it keeps its name, then its
  start time, and leaves the picture out: a half-hour Dinner says "Dinner
  18:30".
- The category colours are spread further apart, so School, Study and Sleep
  no longer look alike, and Sleep is darker than the rest.
- Paper is a cream planner page with an ink-blue accent, serif words and
  figures, and no shadows. Pastel has tinted cards and fuller block colours.
- The Sand accent is a clay brown, so it no longer looks like Gold.
- In Dark, the chosen view (Day, Week, Month, My day) is a lighter chip with
  a ring round it.
- Setup's sports, clubs and jobs each say whether they are Sports or an
  Activity, and keep it when setup is opened again. The example week's
  Soccer is Sports.
- The line for now and the ring round a chosen block use the accent itself,
  darkened or lightened only as far as it takes to show on every category's
  colour (3 to 1, the bar for lines rather than text), so in Light the blue
  stays close to the one picked. The accent stays as picked, and the time on
  the pill keeps its own 4.5 to 1.
- Setup's planning-hours choices (After school, Evenings, Weekend mornings)
  are pills like the day picker's, and Send a test reminder and Add custom
  hours are outlined buttons, so none reads as plain text. The example
  homework is greyed "e.g. History essay" in the muted colour; it is only
  words in an empty box, so leaving it adds nothing and Done says "None yet".
- Setup's School now sits in a card like each sport, club or job, with the
  Sports or Activity choice beside the name, so the times line up down the page.
- Setup names each design as Settings does: "Today's app", not "Calendar ·
  Today's app", on its cards, day screens and the Done page.
- Sign in says the name once, in the wordmark; the heading is "Welcome" (and
  "Welcome back"). Creating an account is the stronger link under Sign in and
  Forgot password the lighter. A link under the pointer or reached by the
  keyboard turns a darker shade of the accent and is underlined, where it went
  near-black, and showed nothing at all by keyboard.
- On Today's app's Week, a Saturday or Sunday with nothing on it is narrower
  than the other days (60 % of one, and never under 96 pixels, so a block
  dropped there still reads), and the days with something in them share the
  rest equally. It widens as soon as something is put on it.
- Blocks that share a time no longer carry a black dot at their corner: they
  already sit side by side, and the dot covered the end of the name. Each half
  keeps two pixels more room for its words. Clay and Retro had kept theirs;
  those are gone too.
- Retro's and Bento's Week at the narrowest window (810 pixels) names each
  block and says when it starts, "Sch…" over "08:00", as Today's app's Week
  does: Retro's blocks said nothing and Bento's said "Sc…" alone. A name is cut
  short only when it does not fit, and the picture before it goes before the
  name drops below three letters.
- Changing pages no longer dips through a blank moment: the old page fades
  steadily and the new one comes in just behind it, so the window is never
  empty, and the page's title fades with it instead of changing first.
  Reduce cross-fades without sliding, so it is visibly calmer than Normal.
- The top bar's buttons grey only once FlexWeek has been busy a moment (a
  plan takes milliseconds), but they take no clicks, keys or shortcuts
  from the first moment. After a plan the hours ease to the first placed
  homework instead of jumping, and stay put when it already shows; the
  plan's words are said once, with Undo, instead of plain first and then
  rewrapped.
- Ctrl+K rises further over a longer moment, so its rise is seen after the
  window dims, and a notice said while it is open goes under the dimming.
- On the focus screen, the ring before Start is drawn between the track
  and the accent, so it reads as set, not finished.
- Actions that are not a page's answer are outlined buttons, words inside
  a hairline: Settings' Availability…, Manage account…, Run setup again,
  Check for updates and Add alarm, recovery codes' Copy and Save…, More
  details, Routines' Close, Reset this layout's options and the look
  editor's Save as new. As plain words none of them read as a button, and
  the filled button stays the one answer.
- Settings' Appearance page opens on Colours, with the look's fine-tuning
  inside it, then the designs. The switches read "Show shape, spacing and
  type" and "Show more options for this design", and Customise's row is
  "Your own look", not "Customise" twice.
- Ctrl+K has a Settings group: Look and colours, Customise look…, and each
  Settings page.
- While a timer runs, one line over the week says its name, its time and
  a way to the Focus screen: Now and Next, Quick focus and the sentence on
  what to do no longer stack three strips. What to do next is the time's
  tip while it runs, and said once it ends. The Focus screen button is
  outlined, no longer louder than Add.
- More looks is a grid of small weeks drawn in each look's own colours and
  corners, each with its name; one click, or Space or Enter, wears it.
  Looks you saved follow under "Your looks", the worn look's picture is
  marked, and while Light, Dark or System shows no choice because one of
  your own is worn, the line under the pictures names it ("Wearing …").
- The Settings footer keeps its one sentence, "Changes are saved as you
  make them.": a routine's "Saving preferences…" and "Saved preferences."
  no longer replace it, while anything that needs reading still does. Each
  page lines its labels up in one column.
- Settings' design cards sit in one grid whose rows are full, the ones
  still being tried tagged "Experimental" on their card, instead of those
  under a heading of their own with a last card standing alone.
- Every sheet starts with its title and a close button, and stacks each
  label above its field, so every field starts at one edge: Add and Edit
  said nothing about what they were. Form sheets are 440 pixels wide and
  list sheets 600, where the two editors were different widths, and Start
  and End sit side by side under their labels, which keeps the block
  editor inside the window at 1280x800. The block editor picks its days
  with the pills setup already had, not tick boxes.
- Routines, Help, About, Running late and School hours open as sheets
  inside the window, centred, each with its title and a close button.
  They were windows of their own with title bars, Running late off to one
  side. Routines is one card with two headed parts, its lists a fixed
  height and its name beside Save, so it fits 1280x800. Help puts its
  four screens two by two above one column of shortcuts, each key on one
  line with its words beside it. Running late's summary waits for the
  preview, and a greyed main button in any sheet or dialog keeps its pale
  accent fill but writes its words in the text colour, so Accept late
  start can be read.
- Days are picked with pills everywhere: the alarm editor in Settings >
  Alerts, the work-hours rows used by setup's Homework time step and by
  Availability, and the block editor, Routines and School hours. The
  alarm's days sit on one row under a "Days" label; as tick boxes they
  wrapped into two rows.
- Every date in a sheet (homework's Due, Routines' Week of, Spread's
  Starting, and setup's first homework) opens a month drawn in your look:
  Monday first, the days named by one letter with Saturday and Sunday in
  the same colour as the rest, the picked day a round dot in the accent,
  today ringed, other months' days faint, and chevron arrows. The stock
  calendar drew weekends red and the picked day as a square.
- Numbers in sheets, setup and Settings (a homework's length, setup's
  first homework and reminder lead, Focus's lengths and long-break count,
  the reminder lead and the volume) sit between a minus and a plus big
  enough to hit, which stop at their ends, grey with the box, and repeat
  while held. A homework's length has 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 as pills
  under it, the one matching the value lit.
- Every clock time (a block's Start and End, a due time, Choose a time,
  study windows, a new alarm, setup's times) is typed with no arrows
  inside the box; they were too small to hit and took a quarter of it.
  The volume reads "80%", Focus's Timer preset is as wide as the fields
  around it, and sheets grow with Large text so their fields fit.

### Fixed
- Today's app's hours end at 23:00: the "24:00" label under them is gone, in
  Day and Week.
- In the rail, a homework's title is cut only when the row has no room for it:
  "Math worksheet" beside "Today 16:15" is now said whole.
- The line for now crosses a block over its colour and stops a few pixels
  short of the block's words and picture, in every design, so it shows how far
  into the block you are without crossing its name out. Timeline's and Clay
  deck's pills with the time sit beside the hours instead of on the block.
- Timeline's pill with the time is beside the hour labels, in place of the
  one it is nearest, or for a day on the right page in that page's margin at
  the fold. It lay on the day before and covered its blocks.
- In the Look editor, Readability lists each place a pale accent of your own
  is used as words (Plan, today's name, the line for now) with a Fix, and the
  app draws those words darker until then. The stock accents are not listed.
  The line for now is listed only when it would not show (under 3 to 1), not
  when it is merely too pale for text.
- Terminal's Next card wraps the time left instead of cutting it off.
- The look pictures in Settings widen with the text, so at Large text, as in
  High contrast, each name stays on one line.
- Day keeps Now on the hours grid rather than between agenda rows. Week titles, time labels, recovery codes and category tick/action spacing are clearer at narrow widths.
- On a week that runs into a new month, Month and the mini month show the month
  that holds today, so today is no longer faded like last month's days. Month
  to Day opens the day you picked, and My day's title names the day.
- Day, Week and every design keep the hours where you scrolled them when you
  switch views, open the focus screen or Settings, or change the look. They
  open at now when FlexWeek starts, when you press Today, and when you come
  back to this week; the week you pressed Today from stays where you left it.
- Help and the other scrolling sheets use the app's thin scroll bar, as Ctrl+K and Settings do, instead of a thick one that took width from the words.
- At a narrow window Week's day header shows a day's homework as "1 h 30" when "1 h 30 min" would be cut off.
- Setup's style and look cards fit a narrow window: they run one to a row when
  two would not fit, instead of running off the right edge at 810 pixels.
- Clay deck's side days are whole and say what is in them: on Week the day
  two away was cut by the window's edge, and on Day both neighbours ran
  past it, so a neighbour's homework was a pink bar whose name was drawn
  off screen. A side card now narrows to the room beside the card in
  front, and a card the edge would cut waits wholly past it until the row
  slides it in. Each side card also labels its hours down its left, so it
  no longer reads as a day of its own, and the shading at the row's ends
  stays off the cards in view.
- In Bento's Week, a column too narrow for a block's whole time says when
  it starts, "School 08:00", instead of the name alone: at the window's
  usual width "08:00-14:30" had no room, so School, Soccer practice and
  the rest said their names with no times. A wide column keeps the range.
- Bento's Due soon says "left · due Thursday 1" (or "due at 21:00", "due
  by the end of today") rather than "until Thursday 1", and both Bento
  and Retro write a placed time as "placed Wed 19:00", the word Mission
  control already uses, so a time the homework sits at is not read as its
  deadline.
- Bento's Due soon rows keep the placed time whole in a narrow tile: they
  say the length and where it is placed while every row has room, and
  otherwise all say where it is placed, instead of cutting the time off
  or one row dropping its length while the rest kept theirs.
- The hours keep their place when a design lays its page out again after
  a drop and there is briefly less to scroll: Retro's hours jumped back a
  little instead.
- Clay deck's Day opens at the day's first block, not at now: while the
  open card was still sliding in, its hours had no width, and a time
  asked for then was kept for a showing that never came. Hours asked for
  a time while they have no room now go there once room returns.
- Mission control's Focus minutes say "Focusing now", "Focus paused" or
  "On a break" while a session runs, instead of "None yet this week"; the
  minutes stay those already credited.
- School hours' note "No school days picked means no school on the
  calendar" shows only when no day is picked, not under a week of picked
  days.
- In Ctrl+K, the row Enter will run is tinted with the accent (a row
  under the pointer keeps its grey), the list shows every row while the
  window has room — it stopped at ten and showed a scroll bar beside a
  list that fit — and each key hint is drawn as a keycap, with "+" plain
  between them.
- The More menu's groups each sit under a heading: Planning, Edit, Help
  and info and Account; only Planning had one. A greyed Unfinished with
  nothing under it says "None left" on its row, not only in its tooltip.
- In Settings > Alerts, a new alarm's time starts at 07:00 rather than
  00:00, its Spotify field is labelled "Spotify link" (its hint says
  "Optional"), and Remove alarm shows only while there is an alarm to
  remove.
- A notice in Retro desktop no longer covers the taskbar's tray (the bell
  and the clock): it keeps above the bar, as in every other design.
- With the 12-hour clock, the hour labels and the pill for the time now show
  whole in Today's app, Timeline, Bento, Retro and Clay, at any text size and
  zoom. They were cut off on the left, so 9:00 AM read ":00 AM". Changing the
  clock in Settings fits them at once. Mission control's hours no longer run
  together when its lanes are zoomed out.

## [0.17.1] - 2026-09-29

### Changed
- Mission control's cards under the lanes (Up next, Free time left, and
  another day's list) end with "and N more" when some rows have no room,
  instead of leaving them out without a word.
- One thing's countdown ring eases down each minute rather than jumping, as
  the mock-up's does. Under Reduce and Off it moves at once, and a new
  countdown fills the ring at once.
- The plan review opens downward as it fades in, so the page below it moves
  with it instead of jumping in one frame.

### Fixed
- Holding a block at the edge of the hours scrolls about two hours a second
  at any zoom. In Clay deck it raced through the day at about 16 hours a
  second.
- A block partly scrolled out of view writes its name in the part that
  shows, instead of having words cut by the edge of the view.
- Short blocks on Clay deck's side cards keep their names, shortened at a
  word where they must, instead of showing as bare colour.
- A block's times and length read at 4.5 to 1 in every look. Terminal's were
  3.95 to 1.
- Homework not placed yet keeps one order (due, then title) from one plan to
  the next.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added
- Newsreader and JetBrains Mono ship with the app, as Inter does, in four
  weights each. The Serif font sets headings in Newsreader over Inter; the Mono
  font is JetBrains Mono throughout.
- Ink, Paper's night counterpart: a charcoal page with warm ivory text and
  serif headings, whatever the account's look.
- Looks of your own. Customise… under Look in Settings opens the look editor
  over Settings. Start from any look, or from one you saved, and change the
  accent (a swatch or any colour), the page, card, text and line colours, each
  category's colour (a hue on the family, or an exact colour), the corners,
  spacing, shadows, the body and heading fonts, the text size, how blocks are
  drawn (the edge's width, and whether times and lengths show), the hour lines,
  today's highlight, the now line and the motion. The window wears each change
  at once, and the right of the editor shows the week as the look dresses it,
  fitted or at its real size. Readability lists every pair of colours under 4.5
  to 1, each with a Fix that moves that colour's lightness until it reads, and
  Fix all. Each section says when it has changed and has its own Reset; Reset
  all goes back to the look as you last saved it, or as it was when you
  started. The editor itself stays in the look you started from, so a colour
  that does not read never hides its controls.
- Looks you keep. The editor's header says whether the look is saved. Done
  saves it under its name, and a new look never replaces a saved one: it is
  numbered, as "My look 2". Back or Esc with changes not saved asks once: Save,
  Keep without saving, or Discard changes, which goes back to the look as
  saved, or takes a look never saved off. A look kept without saving shows in
  More looks as "My look (not saved)". Saved looks are listed under "Your
  looks" at the end of More looks, can be renamed, duplicated and deleted, and
  are kept on this computer. Export writes a look to a small file to share, and
  Import reads one and says plainly what was wrong with a file that is not a
  look.
- Animations has a fourth level, Reduce, between More and Off: every fade
  stays, and nothing slides, rises, drifts, zooms or lifts. Settings shows the
  look's own level until you pick one, so Paper, or a look of your own, starts
  where the look says. The look editor's Motion has the same four levels and
  Play it on the preview.
- The focus screen counts down in a ring: the time left as an arc in the
  accent, from the top clockwise, with the minutes large in the middle. One
  thing's Countdown draws the same ring.
- Ctrl+K groups what it offers under Add, Go to and Homework, with an icon on
  every row and the key on the right for Day, Week, Month, My day and the focus
  screen. The group with the best match comes first, so Enter runs it.
- Menus have an icon on every row. The right-click menu shows Enter, Ctrl+D and
  Del beside what they do, and sets Delete and Delete homework apart, in red.

### Changed
- Every screen is drawn in one system: one accent, neutral pages and cards, one
  type scale, set spacing and corners, two shadows, Lucide's icons, one family
  of category colours, and red only for a problem. Ten looks are drawn in it:
  Light, Dark, High contrast, Slate, Nocturne, Paper, Ink, Terminal, Poster and
  Pastel, with System following the computer between Light and Dark.
- Slate, Nocturne, Paper, Terminal, Poster and Pastel are redrawn as the 0.17
  mock-up draws them, each in the one accent: Slate cool grey-blue, Nocturne
  midnight, Paper ink on off-white with serif headings and quieter category
  fills, Terminal GitHub-dark in JetBrains Mono, Poster black lines and bolder
  fills on cream, Pastel lavender. A look saved in 0.16 opens as its new self.
  Paper starts at the Reduce motion level when no level was chosen.
- The accent's words always read at 4.5 to 1: on a tinted page that needs it,
  as Slate's and Pastel's, the accent is its own shade a little darker.
- The knobs are renamed as they are drawn: Surface Flat or Layered, Corners
  Soft (6 and 10), Sharp (0 and 2) or Round (10 and 16), Shadows None, Soft or
  Bold, Blocks Edge, Filled or Outline. Saved choices keep their meaning.
- Today's app has a rail on the left of Day and Week in place of the side
  panel on the right: a small month with this week banded, today in the accent
  and a dot on each day homework is due; what is next and what follows it;
  homework not placed yet, as chips with the book and the length at the right;
  and the homework to start a focus timer on, in time order with the time at
  the right. A running timer is its first card. The month folds away from a
  control on its header and stays folded after a restart. The week takes the
  rest of the width, and each day's header says its hours of homework.
- Day lists the day beside its hours: each thing's times and length, the time
  now as a line, and a summary with a bar and a dot for each kind of thing. It
  no longer puts what is next in a band above the hours.
- Blocks have a 3-pixel edge in their category's colour, with Edge the default
  block style. Titles are at 600 and times muted, blocks back to back are 3
  pixels apart, no line ends in a dot, homework carries a book, and 12-hour
  times are short ("4–5:30 PM"). A block says its title on up to two lines,
  then its times and length, then "Dinner 18:30" on one line; a title gives way
  at a space only when nothing else fits, and a block with no room for three
  letters shows its colour alone.
- Today's date is an accent chip in its header on Week and Day.
- Day and Week open at the time now, in the middle of what shows, each time
  they are shown: switched to, back from Settings or the focus screen, and in a
  new look. After Plan they scroll to the first homework it placed.
- Month's rows are as tall as their busiest date, up to six chips, this week
  is banded, and its day names are in sentence case.
- The plan result is one slim bar: "Placed 2 · 1 without a time", Details,
  Replan as text and Got it filled.
- One accent: FlexWeek's blue, the icon's (`#3d6fc4` on light looks, `#7fa8ff`
  on dark ones), in every look but High contrast, which keeps its yellow
  (`#ffd400`) whatever swatch is picked. Sky, Sea, Gold and Sand still replace
  it. The accent marks controls only: it no longer washes today's column or the
  setup cards.
- Light and Dark are neutral: a `#f7f8fa` page with white cards, and a
  `#111315` page with `#1a1d21` cards. Light frost and Dark frost load as these,
  and System follows the computer between them.
- The categories are one family: every fill at one lightness and every mark at
  another, worked out from OKLCH, so no category shouts over the others. On a
  dark look a block is its category sunk into the card, written in the look's
  own text colour. Homework's mark is darker than the rest, so it stays apart
  from Sports for a student who cannot tell red from green.
- Soft corners (0.16's Round) are 6 pixels on controls and 10 on cards; the
  toast and the command bar take a sheet's 16.
- Today's column is washed with 3 % of the text colour on Week and not at all
  on Day. The now line and its time are in the accent: red is for what cannot
  be.
- High contrast: text at 7 to 1 or more, the grid's rules and the hairlines at
  40 % white instead of full white. Day, Week, Month and My day, and every
  choice of two or three in Settings, read in white on black with the chosen
  one filled yellow, where the view control was yellow on light grey.
- Sign in: the FlexWeek wordmark sits on the page above one centred card,
  rounded as a sheet and lifted with the large shadow, under one heading
  ("Welcome to FlexWeek", or "Welcome back"). The password box has an eye
  inside it that shows and hides the password, in place of a Show button that
  made the box narrower than the username's; logging out hides it again.
  Creating an account hides Forgot password, and Forgot password turns the card
  into Reset your password, with its own one filled button. The card widens
  with Large text, so no line on it is cut.
- The recovery codes are in Inter with figures of one width, on a quiet panel,
  instead of a second, heavier fixed-width face.
- Setup: each page and its Back, Skip and Next buttons are centred up to 880
  pixels wide, where they were pinned to the left. The rail marks each step
  with its number in a ring and a finished one with a tick. Next is the only
  filled button: Add custom hours and Send a test reminder are plain. The line
  about no school days shows only when no school day is picked. Play is an
  icon. Its titles and headings are on the type scale. The style cards'
  pictures are drawn by the designs themselves, so they show the new designs.
- Help: the shortcuts are drawn as keys, the words fade out at a scroll edge
  with more past it, and the line saying a tutorial is coming is gone. About
  shows the FlexWeek logo beside the version.
- Add homework and Edit event open inside the window: a card with rounded
  corners and a soft shadow over the week, which dims behind it. Every other
  dialog stays a window of its own.
- In every dialog the form sits on one card, with no pale box inside it. Each
  label sits on the same line as the words in its field, and every time box,
  date, number box and dropdown in a dialog is as wide as the others of its
  kind rather than as wide as the row.
- Edit event asks "Apply to: This day only | Every selected day" under the
  days, and only for a block that repeats, instead of two round buttons above
  the title.
- Account is three cards: Password, Recovery codes and Your data, each with its
  own buttons; Delete account is red words at the end of Your data.
- A button that cannot be pressed yet, such as Accept late start before
  Preview, keeps its colour at 40 % instead of turning into a grey slab.
- Routines and a homework's checklist tick their rows with the same boxes as
  every other check box.
- Settings: the cards stand in a column centred in the page, up to 960 pixels;
  each section has its icon in the list and the open one a bar in the accent;
  Look is "Light | Dark | System" with every other look under More looks;
  Accent is a row of colour swatches; every number box and dropdown on a page
  is one width; and a hairline ends the page above Done. Customise… under Look
  opens the look editor. An alarm's time and sound are on lines of their own,
  and the drag step's question is said above its choice.
- The focus screen wears the look. Pause, Start or Finished is the one filled
  button; Skip, Finish and Take a break are words beside it, and Back has a
  chevron.
- Quick focus opens the focus screen ready, as F does: nothing starts until
  Start.
- The toast is dark with light words, 16-pixel corners and a small shadow, and
  Undo is in the accent's light shade with its arrow. It sits bottom right of
  the page, and goes when the student leaves the page it was said on: "Planned
  2 homework blocks." no longer stays over the focus screen.
- Ctrl+K dims the window by 40 % and fades in, and its box is a sheet with the
  large shadow and a borderless search field.
- Menus take the look's colours, with the large shadow where the look has
  depth and a quiet tint on the row under the pointer instead of the accent.
  Log out sits after a line of its own, and Advanced is now "Undo, copy and
  save", for what it holds.
- One type scale: captions 11 pt, body text 13, headings 15, titles 20 and
  display numbers 28 at Normal text, which Small and Large scale together. Two
  weights, regular and semibold; bold only for the focus screen's countdown.
  Body text is a point larger than before, and titles, headings and the grid's
  small words each have one size wherever they appear.
- The top bar, as the 0.17 mock-up draws it: the arrows and Today come before
  the title, so they no longer move when the title's width changes; the arrows,
  the gear, Add's arrow, More's arrow and the zoom are Lucide's icons in the
  text colour instead of text glyphs; Add is one pill with a line between Add
  and its arrow; Plan my homework is accent words on a tint of the accent;
  More is in the text colour; the chosen view is raised on its track by a small
  shadow.
- Every button has the same states: 6 % of the text colour on hover, 10 % when
  pressed, a 2-pixel ring when reached with the keyboard (not after a click),
  and 40 % when it cannot be pressed.
- The week, Day, Month, Settings and the focus list scroll under a thin scroll
  bar laid over their edge, which widens under the pointer; the bar no longer
  takes a strip of its own. The zoom is a small "− +" pill.
- One thing counts down to what is next on a ring, as the focus screen does:
  the minutes to go are an arc in the accent from the top, with "Up next", the
  name and its times inside and the minutes large. What comes after is listed
  under Then with its times, category dots and lengths. Running late is the
  one filled button unless homework is on, and the words are in sentence case
  instead of capitals. A long title takes two lines and is shortened past
  that, with the whole name when the pointer rests on it. The day bar stays,
  for dragging blocks later.
- Day dial draws the whole day as a 24-hour ring, midnight at the bottom and
  noon at the top: each block is a segment in its category's colour, 2
  degrees from the next, and paler once it is over. The hour marks sit outside
  the ring, the hand stops at its inner edge, and the time sits under the hub
  with the free time left before 22:00. Beside the dial are Up next, with what
  follows it, and the day's list in columns (start, title and length), a past
  row marked Done rather than struck through. The week's small dials run along
  the bottom.
- Timeline is a paper planner opened flat. Monday to Wednesday are on the left
  page and Thursday to Sunday on the right, each day a column of the whole
  day's hours, with blocks as cards outlined in ink with their category's tab
  and homework filled in its colour with the book. At the foot of the left page
  are the week in figures and what is next; at the foot of the right, sticky
  notes of what is not placed yet and what is due this week. A day's name opens
  it. Day opens the planner at that day: its hours on the left page, and on the
  right its summary, what is next, what is due and the notes.
- Mission control is an ops board. Four figures run across the top: homework
  planned today, homework due this week, the free time left today until 22:00,
  and the focus minutes on this week's homework. Under them the days are lanes
  of hours from 08:00 to 22:00, today's edged in the accent, and beside them a
  table of deadlines, the soonest first, with what each homework needs, the
  time left ("Past due" in red), how much of it is placed and where. Homework
  not placed yet is dragged from its row onto a lane. Blocks of 30 minutes or
  less are ticks in their colour, named when the pointer rests on them. Day is
  the day as one wide lane, with Up next and the free time left today under it.
  Figures are in JetBrains Mono.
- Bento has "Hero: Week | Today" in its settings, Week first. With Week, the
  week's hours are the big tile, with Next, Due soon, the week's homework load
  and Not placed yet around it. With Today, today's hours are the big tile,
  beside what is next, the week at a glance and Not placed yet, and the other
  six days are small tiles with their first item, their load and their
  homework. A day tile lifts when the pointer is on it and offers "Show Friday
  here"; a click shows that day in the big tile, or on Day opens it.
- Clay deck is a row of cards, one day at a time. Today's card is in the middle
  at full size with its hours, the days either side peek at 70 %, and the round
  arrows beside the card, or the wheel over the days either side, slide it a
  day. The wheel over the card in front scrolls its hours. Not placed yet rests
  in a dish under the row. A block goes to the next day by a drop on its card,
  and further by resting on an arrow while it is held. Day opens the card
  wider, with the day's hours by kind and, today, what is left of it.
- Retro desktop is Windows 98 as it was drawn: two-pixel bevels, square corners
  and navy-to-blue title bars. Week.exe holds the hours, with a menu bar, day
  names as buttons and a status bar; deadlines.txt is Notepad, with each
  homework under its deadline and when it is placed; Up next is a dialog with
  the clock and what is next; icons run down the left; and the taskbar has
  Start, a button per window and the clock. Minimise, maximise and close work,
  a taskbar button opens its window, brings it to the front, or puts it away
  when it is already in front, the Week.exe and deadlines.txt icons open their
  windows, and Start opens More's menu. Words are in Pixelify Sans and Notepad
  in VT323, both shipped with the app. Day adds a pane beside the hours with
  what is planned, what is still to come and the free time from now. Under High
  contrast it is Windows 98's High Contrast Black.
- Every design uses the top bar's Add, and the small zoom pill every design
  has; Bento's red-orange zoom and the Add buttons some designs drew of their
  own are gone.
- Colourways: One thing's Black and orange is now Poster, the same black page
  in your accent instead of orange. Day dial's Midnight is now Night, navy in
  your accent. Clay deck's Pastel is now Clay, lavender in your accent, and
  every card is one colour instead of a pastel per day. Timeline's Paper is now
  Ruled paper, in FlexWeek's blue whatever your accent, and its Night is blue
  on dark instead of white. Mission control adds Flight deck, blue on dark,
  before Cyan, Amber and Green. On Poster's and Night's dark pages your accent
  keeps its hue and is made only as much lighter as its words need to read at
  4.5 to 1. A colourway chosen before is still chosen, under its new name.
- Every page change fades through: the old page out in 90 ms, then the new one
  in over 120 ms, so two pages are never read on top of each other. Day, Week
  and Month also slide 12 pixels toward the view chosen, and the arrows keep
  their drift. The new page is there at once, so a click never waits for an
  animation.
- A change of view, My day or design changes the top bar and the page in the
  same frame. Parts that did not move, such as the rail between Week and Day,
  neither blink nor drift.
- Settings slides in from the right over the week, which dims by 20 %, in
  200 ms, and slides away again. At Reduce it fades through instead.
- Sheets, dialogs and Ctrl+K fade in and rise 8 pixels, on Wayland too, which
  ignored a window's own fade.
- The top bar's chosen view is a pill that slides to the new view in 160 ms,
  or fades across at Reduce.
- The slide after Plan is seen: scrolling to the first homework it placed cut
  it short. At Reduce a block that moved fades in where it went.
- Each design moves only as far as the level allows: Clay deck's row slides a
  day, a Bento tile lifts, the dial's hand eases to the time in 240 ms, and
  Retro desktop's windows open with Windows 98's zoom rectangle from their
  taskbar button or icon. Nothing loops.
- Animations' "More movement" is now More. Light and Dark start at Normal, as
  every look but Paper does, where 0.16 started them at More, so Light moved
  more than System. A level you chose stays.

### Removed
- Day dial's Hours shown: the ring is always the whole day.
- Timeline's Week strip: the top bar's arrows and the week's day names reach
  every day.
- Mission control's Hours shown, which the design never read, and the deadline
  radar's Show or Hide. The figures across the top can be hidden instead.
- Bento's Supporting tiles: both heroes draw every tile.
- Clay deck's Week cards (Fanned or Straight): the cards no longer fan. Days
  either side (Show or Hide) is its option now.
- A saved choice of any of these is dropped when read, and the rest of the
  design's settings are kept.

### Fixed
- Retro desktop no longer closes FlexWeek when it redraws its day. Its hours
  were kept aside while Week.exe's row still listed them, and the next redraw
  could reach freed memory.
- After Retro desktop, the zoom keys and the rest of the keyboard work again.
  Three of its labels opened for a moment as windows of their own and took
  the keyboard from FlexWeek's window.
- Bento opens its week at now, as every design does. In a narrow window, and
  in the Today hero at any size, Not placed yet stays in view beside the hours,
  so homework can always be dragged onto them; it fell below the window with
  large text.
- Holding a block at the edge of Bento's hours scrolls from the time on
  screen, not from the first block of the day.
- A short block pressed anywhere in its time is picked up, its last pixel
  included, in every design. A press in the gap at its end started a new block
  over it.
- In Mission control, blocks that share their time in one lane each get a whole
  row, so a short one reads rather than shrinking to a sliver, and the cards
  under the lanes show whole rows only.
- Setup's pictures of the designs are taken once each has finished laying out,
  at the size the designs were drawn at: Mission control's showed a scroll bar
  beside a half-drawn table, and Timeline's short day names sat over the wrong
  hours.
- A look of your own draws its text on blocks in the colour you chose, and
  Readability says when that is hard to read on a category's colour, with a Fix.
  Blocks swapped the text to black or white instead, so the warning never
  showed. The Look editor's type follows the Text knob as every screen does.
- While a look of your own is worn, Settings shows the accent and Fine-tune
  choices it sets, and they cannot be changed there: a line under each says
  the look sets them and to open Customise…. They looked live and changed
  nothing. Choosing a built-in look gives them back as they were.
- A switch whose words wrap, as at Large text, shows every line. The last line
  fell below the switch's foot.
- In the homework editor, Enter saves. It pressed More details, the first
  button after the title, because Save was made the default before it was in
  the dialog.
- The plan bar counts what the toast counts, the homework the plan gave a time
  and the homework it could not. It counted every block with a time, School
  included, and said 2 placed under a toast that said 0.
- An hour label the edge of the hours would cut is left out, not moved off its
  rule.
- Changing the look with the week open, to High contrast above all, no longer
  runs the words of the Not placed yet chips off their edge, and the focus
  list beside the week no longer grows a sideways scroll bar or hides a row: a
  long name gives up its middle and keeps its time.
- The top bar, the window's frame, dialogs and Today's app always wear your
  look and accent. A design's own colourway colours only the design's page, and
  every design starts in Match my look; its signature colourways are still
  there to pick, and one saved before still loads. Look and Accent stay in
  Settings whatever the design, since they dress the window in every one.
- Red means a problem. Month's deadlines are quiet chips led by a bold "Due",
  whose flag turns red only once the date has gone without the homework being
  finished; the red outlined boxes are gone. Dates outside the month are
  white like the rest, told apart by their dimmed numbers. Homework waiting for
  a time is edged in homework's colour, not red, and Account says how many
  recovery codes are left in the muted colour, in red only when none are.
- Month draws each block in its category's fill, as the week does, rather than
  the strong colour washed over the date. So do Clay deck and Mission control,
  whose blocks were their category's mark lightened or darkened: pale on light
  cards and sunk into dark ones, with words that read on them.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added
- Homework can be deleted: with Delete at the bottom left of its editor, with
  Delete beside each homework under Unfinished, or with Delete homework on its
  right-click menu, which is also how homework with no time yet goes. It asks
  first. Its times go too, in every week, even weeks not open, and one Undo
  brings the homework and all of them back.
- FlexWeek brings its own typeface, Inter, in four weights, so it looks the same
  on every computer. A computer without the files falls back to its own sans.
- The now line carries the time, "15:40", on a small pill where it starts.
- A new account's empty week says "Nothing here yet." with one button, "Add
  your first homework", in place of empty hours on Week and Day. The hours come
  back with the first block or homework. A student who has homework keeps the
  hours on every week.
- A focus screen: Start focus, Quick focus or F shows the timer on its own, the
  countdown large, with the phase, the homework, and Pause, Skip and Finish.
  With no timer running it offers Start. Back or Esc returns to the week and
  the timer keeps running.
- Ctrl+K opens a command bar: type a few letters of Add homework, Add fixed
  time, School hours, Day, Week, Month, My day, Plan my homework, Settings,
  Help, Focus screen or any homework's name, and press Enter. Help lists F and
  Ctrl+K.
- A 12-hour clock. Settings > This computer > Clock offers 24-hour (as before)
  or 12-hour, and every time FlexWeek writes follows it: "4:00 PM" on the
  hours, blocks, Month, due dates, the Next line, reminders, Running late,
  setup and the time boxes. Times are still saved as 16:00.
- Recovery codes have Copy, which puts all eight on the clipboard, and Save…,
  which writes them to a text file, one per line. They are drawn in a
  fixed-width face so 0 and O, 1 and l read apart.
- FlexWeek's own icon: a blue rounded square with three white week blocks,
  drawn by `scripts/brand.py` into `desktop/assets/logo.png` and a
  multi-size `logo.ico` the Windows build now uses. Sign in and the recovery
  codes page show it beside the wordmark.
- Help lists Ctrl+K (Command bar) and F (Focus screen).
- Right-click a block, on the hours, Month or among homework with no time yet,
  for Open, Duplicate, Finished (homework) and Delete. Delete asks first and
  can be undone; Duplicate shows the same preview as Ctrl+D.

### Changed
- Every time is written in figures of one width: the hours, a block's times,
  the Next line and every time box, so a column of times stays straight.
- Cards are padded 16 px, or 8 at Compact spacing, and dialogs 24. Buttons,
  fields, lists and menus keep their size.
- Activity blocks are teal, so they no longer look like homework's coral.
- On a dark look a block is its category's colour sunk into the page, written
  on in white, instead of a pale fill that glared.
- The hours have a rule at each hour and none at the half hour, and the rules
  are stronger on a dark look. Today's column is washed a little more, and its
  name above the week is in the accent with a line under it.
- While a focus timer runs, the strip above the hours shows one line and a
  Focus screen button; Pause, Skip and Reset are on the focus screen.
- Help is two columns over a wide window: the screens as short cards on the
  left, the keyboard shortcuts on the right. At large text it is one column.
- About says "Your plans are saved on this computer." with an Open folder
  button, instead of printing the folder's path.
- Running late's preview says "from 16:00 to 17:30", "placed at 18:00" or
  "moves off 19:00 and is not placed" instead of arrows, and setup's "Choose
  my own look instead" loses its arrow.
- The top bar's Day, Week, Month and My day are one segmented control, the
  chosen view raised in it.
- Add is the top bar's one filled button: a click adds homework, and its arrow
  offers Add fixed time, School hours and the types to drag onto the calendar.
  Adding left the More menu. Plan my homework is a plain button beside it.
- Week has a side, as Day does: the Next line, the homework to start a focus
  timer on, and Not placed yet, beside the hours instead of stacked above
  them. Above the hours only a running focus timer shows. On a window under
  1150 pixels the side folds into one line above the hours, "Next: … · Not
  placed yet: 2" with the chips after it, and blocks show their names only, on
  two lines if they need them, so "Soccer practice" is not cut to "Soccer …".
- One toast carries every notice: what a drag, Plan, Finished or Delete did,
  with its Undo; Find a new time; Open release page; reminders; and anything
  FlexWeek has to say. It floats over the foot of the hours, never below the
  window, lets clicks through to the hours except on its button, and goes
  after 6 seconds (12 with a button) or when the student changes view, week,
  day or design. The status line under the hours is gone, and "Saved." is no
  longer said after every change.
- Month opens with the student's week as its first row, the weeks after it
  filling the view and the weeks before a scroll away. In a month's last week
  the week before stays above it, so two weeks always show.
- The smallest window is 800 pixels wide.
- Settings fills the window in place of the week instead of opening as a
  dialog: the sections on the left, each one's settings in cards on the right,
  and Done or Esc goes back. Changes still show at once and save themselves.
  On or off is a switch; two or three choices sit side by side, such as
  Spacing: Comfortable | Compact. The main view and the day screen are picked
  from pictures of each design.
- Today's app and Timeline are the main views offered first, and Day dial is
  the day screen a new account starts with. Mission control, Bento, Retro
  desktop, Clay deck and One thing are under "Experimental styles" in setup
  and Settings. Looks are System, Light, Dark and High contrast, with Nocturne,
  Slate, Poster, Terminal, Paper, Ink and Pastel under the same heading. Every
  saved choice still opens.
- Each dialog has one filled button, its answer. More details, sign in's
  Show, Cancel, Close, Not now, Snooze, Preview, the Account dialog's other
  actions and Routines' Apply and Delete are plain.
- Routines is two cards, "Save this week as a routine" and "Use a saved
  routine", each saying what it does, and says "No routines saved yet." rather
  than showing an empty box. Running late is a card that says nothing changes
  until you accept, and shows its list of moves once there is a preview. A
  running focus timer is a card with Pause as its one filled button.
- A click on a block opens it; a drag still moves or resizes it, and Enter
  still opens the chosen block. A double-click opens it once, and its second
  click does nothing to the editor the first opened.
- School hours asks what setup asks: the days, and from and to. Ticking no day
  takes School off the calendar. It used to open the Edit event dialog.
- Switching views crossfades the new view in, dialogs ease in, and after Plan
  the blocks that moved slide to their places and new ones fade in. A block
  you drag is simply where you let it go. Animations Off turns all of it off.

### Fixed
- A one-hour block, such as Club at 19:00, shows its name and its times on two
  lines instead of one shortened line.
- The Linux and Windows builds include the icon the window shows. The app looked
  for it beside its code, and no package had ever put it there.
- Finished, after a focus session on homework, finishes the homework. It did
  nothing before.
- Sign in said "Welcome back." on the very first launch. It says "Welcome."
  until someone has signed in on this computer.
- Add homework's Title started as the word "Homework", so typing a title gave
  "HomeworkMath worksheet". It starts empty, with "Homework" as a grey hint.
- Setup's planning-hours presets read as choices that never showed as chosen.
  They are "+ After school", "+ Evenings" and "+ Weekend mornings" buttons
  under "Each adds a row of hours you can change."
- Setup's alarm sounds line up: each Play is level with its sound's name, all
  of them in one column.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added
- Month names every timed block on a date, so weeks other than the open one
  can show their chips.
- A block with a Spotify link plays it when the block starts, the way an alarm
  plays its song. Dismiss stops it and Snooze plays it again five minutes later.
- Help and About, under More. Help says what Day, Week, Month and My day are
  for, lists the keyboard shortcuts, and says a tutorial and guides are coming.
  About gives the version and the folder your plans are saved in.
- Everything under More and Advanced, Plan my homework or Suggest times, and
  the plan review's two buttons say on hover what they do. A greyed item says
  why, such as "Nothing to undo yet."
- Moving, resizing or making a block by dragging says what changed once it is
  saved, under the hours, with Undo beside it: "Moved History essay to Fri
  18:00.", "History essay now ends at 20:30.", "Placed Math worksheet on Thu
  18:00.", "Added Club on Thu 16:00." Carrying a block to another date on Month
  says so too. Undo takes back that one change and says what it undid.
- Everything under More > Advanced, and its keyboard shortcut, says what it did
  under the top bar once it is done: copied, pasted, duplicated, saved, undid
  or redid what, saved a restore point, restored, or reloaded this week.

### Changed
- The block editor is "New event" or "Edit event". Under the day boxes it says
  "Tick more days to repeat it this week.", and the missed box names its day:
  "I missed it on Thursday". Save is the one filled button. Delete is quiet red
  words at the bottom left, asks first, and a deleted block comes back with
  Undo on the notice under the hours.
- Log out and Delete account ask first, and Delete account names the account.
  Log out's answer is drawn in the usual colour, since nothing is lost.
- Settings > Appearance & layout opens on the main view's design, with a
  sentence on what a design is. Its style rows sit on the page rather than in a
  box, and Animations and Fine-tune come last under "Every screen".
- Settings > Focus says "Long break minutes" and "Long break after 4 focus
  sessions". This computer has "Manage account…" on a row of its own, and
  Availability sits on Planning under the sentence that names it. Buttons in
  Settings that open something else are plain and as wide as their words.
- One word for one thing: the Next line says "in 20 min" and "1 h 30 min" as
  every design does, a finished block or focus session says "Finished", and
  homework without a time is "Not placed yet" in every design. The strip under
  Today's app's Next line says "Start a focus timer:".
- Hover descriptions take the text size chosen in Settings.
- Times are by the minute. A block typed as 17:37 to 18:22 in the block editor,
  in setup or in a routine saves as 17:37 to 18:22. Dragging, resizing and
  drawing a block move in steps of 5 minutes, or of 15 if you choose that in
  setup or in Settings > Planning. Homework is still planned on quarter hours,
  and never over any part of one that a block takes.
- Reminders are on unless you turn them off. New accounts start with them on,
  and an account made before this version has them turned on once; if you turn
  them off afterwards, they stay off.
- A reminder shows in FlexWeek as well as in the tray: for a moment under the
  top bar, and on the status line until something more important replaces it.
- Settings > Alerts puts reminders first, with their switch at the top and their
  settings greyed while it is off. Alarms have their own group, and each alarm
  says when it rings. One sound dropdown instead of two; the volume shows a %
  sign, and "Stay in the tray" and "Keep alerts visible until handled" say what
  they do.
- Retro desktop now shows live, draggable hours in Schedule.exe on Day and a
  seven-day Week.exe grid on Week. The deadlines notepad and main window both
  keep unplaced homework within reach, and the status bar shows the time or a
  refusal while dragging. Each tab remembers its scroll and zoom.
- Bento's Day is a full-day Hero clock, and Week is a seven-column Hero board.
  Both have draggable hours and a "Not placed yet" tray. The supporting tiles
  setting can show deadlines and tonight's work or keep only the hero and tray.
- Timeline's Day is one ruled page of the whole day, with homework as ink cards,
  NOW in red, and homework without a time in the margin to drag onto it. Its
  Week reads down the page: each day's big heading beside a line of hours, and
  blocks move along a line or onto another day's line.
- My day moves blocks as every other screen does: drag one along One thing's
  day bar or round Day dial's face, or One thing's big title onto its bar, and
  the new time, or why it cannot go there, shows before you let go. Escape
  puts it back, and a click still opens it.
- Clay deck has one large, draggable Day card and seven live Week cards fanned
  up to 8 degrees. Homework without a time waits in a draggable dish. Week
  cards can also be laid straight in Appearance & layout.
- Mission control has a horizontal Scope lane on Day and seven Lane ops tracks
  on Week. Blocks can move, resize, and be placed from the "Not placed yet"
  tray on either tab. The deadline radar and daily load remain on Week.
- Homework is due on a date. Tick "At a set time" only when it is due at a
  time that day, such as a 09:00 lesson; otherwise it is due by the end of the
  day. Homework saved before keeps its deadline.
- Setup asks when FlexWeek may plan homework, and the planner keeps to those
  hours. Preferred study times are set in Settings, no longer in setup.
- Today's app's week scrolls through the whole day instead of squeezing
  24 hours onto the screen. Day names stay at the top.
- Day and Week zoom: Ctrl and the mouse wheel, Ctrl with =, - or 0, or the
  two buttons above the hours. Each remembers how close it was on this
  computer. A short block can be picked up from its middle at any zoom.
- Ctrl with =, - or 0 zooms the hours on screen wherever the keyboard is, in
  Today's app and every design, not only after a click on the hours.
- A block made by dragging has no category until you choose one, so it no
  longer counts as School in the Day's summary. A type picked under Add, "Then
  drag on the calendar", is still what the next drag makes.

### Removed
- No side drawer of a day's hours opens while a block is dragged in Timeline,
  Bento, Retro desktop or Clay deck. Each design has its own hours to drop on.

### Fixed
- Scrolling down Settings no longer changes the number boxes, time boxes and
  dropdowns the pointer passes over. A box takes the wheel once clicked into.
- Unfinished works in every design; it did nothing in six of seven. With
  nothing unfinished it is greyed and says why.
- Cancelling Running late after a preview takes its "N tasks move" line off
  the screen.
- Sign in and Create account say what went wrong: an empty username or
  password, a password too short to be right, a username that cannot exist or
  is taken, or FlexWeek not reaching its server. Account says "Your plans are
  saved on this computer." as a sentence.
- Settings says FlexWeek 0.15.0; it said 0.14.3.
- Editing one day of a repeating block no longer also says the change applies
  to every selected day.
- Help at large text no longer cuts its keyboard shortcuts in half, and fits
  the screen.
- Retro desktop's Teal, Plum and Slate colours no longer put white text on
  grey in Settings, the editors and the top bar (1.8 to 1). The window takes
  Retro's grey with black text, as Retro's own windows do.
- A block saved inside its own reminder time, such as one at 18:45 saved at
  18:38 with a 10-minute reminder, now reminds at once instead of never.
- "Saved preferences." no longer replaces a reminder on the status line.
- Play beside the alert sound says what to check when no sound comes out:
  that Volume is above 0 % and the speakers or headphones are connected and
  not muted. It said "No sound card", and at Volume 0 blamed the computer.
- New homework starts with today's due date. Changing its due date runs the
  follow-up controls without an error, and invalid details are explained in
  ordinary words.
- Homework lengths outside 15 minutes to 24 hours are refused with a reason.
  The due-date calendar shows its full month in setup and Add homework.
- Plan and Replan all leave past time alone. A saved plan offers Undo; one Undo
  removes every block that plan placed, and Redo restores them. An automatic
  plan stays in the Add homework Undo step. Plan waits for an earlier failed
  save instead of claiming the next plan was stored.
- Hours no longer jump back to the morning after a save in a design that keeps
  them between redraws, and pressing Tab no longer scrolls them to their middle.
- A block's second line of text is never cut in half; what does not fit is
  shortened with "…". A long block keeps its name in sight on lanes that run
  across, as it does in columns. Text no longer gets smaller from one block to
  the next down a day.
- The words beside a held block stay on screen when hours run across.
- Holding a block at the bottom of Timeline's Week scrolls the page down to the
  days below, as it scrolls the hours along at their right-hand edge.
- FlexWeek no longer crashes as it quits after homework waiting for a time or
  pinned, Settings, Account, or a paste preview was opened.
- A block that cannot go where it is held is drawn in red, never in the accent:
  One thing's two colourways, the High contrast and Poster looks, and Bento's
  Sunset had a danger colour equal or close to their accent.
- Mission control no longer draws an extra initial over the shortened words
  on half-hour blocks in Week. Quarter-hour blocks still show an initial when
  their words do not fit.
- Switching to another view, week or design while holding a block puts it
  back, instead of dropping it on whatever the new view shows there.
- Homework waiting for a time shortens its name to fit the tray at large text.
- A rare hang when Python freed a look picture's leftovers while the window
  was painting.
- The planner no longer puts homework at midnight when an hour between
  06:00 and 23:00 is free. Night is still used when the rest of the day is
  full.
- Saving a week no longer fails when finished work ends at midnight. That
  moment is stored as the next date at 00:00, or 23:59 on 31 December 2099
  when there is no next date.
- Homework due on a date with no time is listed after homework due at a set
  time that same day.
- Undo of a block moved to another week no longer throws away later changes
  to that week. If that week changed in another window, Undo is refused and
  both weeks stay as they are.
- "Next: … (in 23m)" counts down with the clock when no focus timer is running.
- Every design's Day and Week open at the time now, or at the first block of
  the day or week shown, each time you go to another day or week. Mission
  control opened at midnight.
- A homework chip shortens its title and keeps its length whole: "Science
  pos… · 1 h 30 min", not "Science poster · 1 h …".
- The top bar keeps whole words at every window width. Where there is no room,
  the title uses its short form and Plan my homework says Plan.
- Retro desktop's deadlines.txt keeps each date on the page at large text, and
  homework with no time shows once: in the notepad, or under the hours while
  the notepad is closed.
- A short block on hours that run across shows its first letter instead of
  lines of "…", and the hour labels at either edge of the scroll stay whole.
- Today's app's "Needs a time" bar no longer blinks empty each time the week
  saves.

## [0.14.3] - 2026-09-22

### Added
- A block can be moved to a date in another week in one save. Undo puts both
  weeks back.
- First-run setup replaces the first-week card. A new account goes from its
  recovery codes to a page at a time, with a step rail, Back, Skip this step
  and Next: a starting style (Plain calendar, Dashboard, Night owl, Retro,
  each a real picture of the design) or Choose my own look, then colours and
  text size; your week, with school days and hours, any number of sports,
  clubs and jobs each on its own days, and No homework after; how homework
  gets a time, with study times that can be kept for one subject; reminders
  and the alarm sound, with Send a test reminder; up to three first homework;
  and a summary with Change links. Each page is kept when you leave it, so a
  quit resumes on the same step. Finishing or skipping is remembered, and
  Settings > This computer > Run setup again opens it filled in with what you
  have now.
- Settings > Planning chooses how homework gets a time: as it is added (one
  Undo takes back the homework and its time), when Plan my homework is pressed
  (the default, as before), or by dragging it yourself, which turns the button
  into Suggest times.
- Homework that needs a time can be dragged from the chips above the Calendar
  onto a day and time, or given one with Choose a time in the homework editor.
  Homework placed by hand is pinned: every plan, Replan all included, leaves
  it where you put it, and Let FlexWeek move it clears the pin.
- Dragging works in every design, not only Today's app. Anything a design shows
  as a block can be picked up. Mission control's lanes, the Day dial's face and
  One thing's day bar take the drop at the time under the pointer. Timeline,
  Bento, Retro desktop and Clay deck open the day's hours at the side while a
  block is dragged: hold it over another day's name to turn to that day, and
  let go on the hours to put it at that time. A drop anywhere says the day, the
  time and the length, and names any block it would sit beside. Anything placed
  by dragging is pinned.
- A study window can be kept for one subject. Plans try a session in its own
  subject's window first, then in a window for any subject, then anywhere.
- One alarm sound, in Settings > Alerts: Chime, Soft, Bright, Low, Glass, or a
  Spotify song or playlist, each with Play. Reminders ring it; a Spotify sound
  is for alarms only, so a reminder never starts music.
- A Spotify alarm plays in the student's own Spotify app instead of opening a
  browser tab, so whole songs play, free or Premium. On Linux FlexWeek tells
  Spotify to play, names the song in the alarm, rings its own tone until the
  music is heard, and pauses Spotify when the alarm is stopped or snoozed. On
  Windows a track opens and starts in the Spotify app, and the media Stop key
  stops it; a playlist, which Spotify will not start by itself there, rings the
  tone too. Without the Spotify app, the link opens in the browser and the tone
  rings.
- Settings > Appearance & layout > Animations: Normal, More movement or Off.

### Changed
- Scrollbars, dropdowns and their lists, spin and time boxes, check boxes,
  radio buttons, menus, tooltips, the date picker and progress bars take the
  colours of the chosen design.
- The Calendar's week works like Daily Scheduler's timeline. Each block is
  one shape instead of a run of table cells, and dragging moves the block
  itself: it follows the pointer a quarter hour at a time, into another day,
  with its new times written on it. Its top or bottom edge resizes it. Empty
  time lights up under the pointer, and dragging across it adds a block of
  that length. Two blocks at one time are allowed and sit side by side, each
  with a dot so the overlap is not missed; only time outside the day's hours
  and homework ending after it is due are refused. Dragging one day of a
  repeating block, such as Wednesday's School, moves only that day. Homework
  placed by hand stays where it was put even beside a fixed block; homework
  the planner placed still makes way. Escape lets go without moving anything.
- Views and pages cross-fade, and moving to another week, day or month slides
  the old one away in the direction you went. Notices rise into place, setup's
  pages slide in from the side you are heading, its step marker glides between
  steps, and Settings slides between its sections. Nothing waits for an
  animation: the new page is live at once.
- The More menu shows its Adding and Planning headings. Due dates read
  "Sun 27 Sep 2026, 23:59" instead of "2026-09-27 23:59".
- A change to the week no longer restyles the whole window when the look is
  the same, which cost about 26 ms and a full repaint on every change.

### Fixed
- A block dragged or dropped while a save was still under way was put back
  when the save finished. It now moves once the save is done.
- On a dark palette on KDE an unticked box, an unselected radio button and the
  spin arrows could not be seen at all.

## [0.14.2] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed
- The first-week setup card grows with each step so Skip and Next no longer
  cover the sport and homework fields. A new account opens on school hours,
  not the previous account's last step. Homework due is this week's Sunday
  with a calendar, not a typed ISO date.
- Plan my homework writes the chosen times onto the week and saves them, so an
  accepted plan is still on the calendar after Save, a normal exit, and signing
  in again. Finishing one assignment, undoing that, or adding an unrelated
  Saturday event leaves other homework where it was.
- Every week layout and both day screens name homework that is due today and
  still needs a time, instead of saying the day is free. Today's app lists that
  work above the week.
- A commitment that covers planned homework takes only that homework's time,
  names it, and offers Find a new time. The rest of the plan stays put. Plan my
  homework keeps times that already work. Replan all my homework is a separate
  action under More and in the plan review.
- Running late stores the delayed start and the new times in one save, so Undo
  once takes both away.
- Month hides the whole week surface in every layout, not only Bento's board.
- Creating an account shows the username rule and names a username that does
  not match. The password can be shown or hidden.
- An estimate that is not a multiple of 15 minutes is an error, not a repeat of
  the hint under the field.
- Optional homework fields sit behind More details, which opens when those
  fields already have values.
- Today sits beside the week arrows. Fixed activities have a Start and an End,
  with the length underneath. The gear stays on a 1024 px wide window in the
  offscreen tests.
- Marking one day of a repeating commitment missed (Monday's school) no longer
  stops the week from saving. It showed "FlexWeek could not display this
  response", and every save after it failed, so later changes were lost on
  restart. Running late on a week with a missed day failed the same way. The
  replan after a missed day is now kept after a reload.
- The week title shows in full beside its arrows instead of being cut to
  "21 – 27 S" underneath them. When the window is too narrow it shortens the
  month names ("28 Sep – 4 Oct") rather than cutting off the end date.
- Fixed activities are only a Start and an End. The Duration box that could
  disagree with them is gone; the length is worked out and shown as "6 h 30 min",
  or as the problem ("End must be after Start.") in red beside the times.
- A Find a new time or Finished notice is said once, on the notice, not again in
  a pop-up, and names every homework that lost its time.
- If Find a new time cannot place homework either, the reason shown is the new
  one, not the sentence from when its old time was taken.
- Settings and the homework editor keep a readable height when the desktop
  gives them less. On 0.14.1 they could be squeezed to 154 px, their minimum,
  which is what the audit saw.
- Day's summary counts only work with a time, or already done, as planned.
  Homework still waiting for a time was billed to every day it could go ("9 h
  15 min planned"). Month's counts follow the same rule: homework with one
  possible day but no time is in the unscheduled total, not on that day.
- The reason homework has no time says what stopped it, such as "Your fixed
  plans and finished work leave no gap long enough for it before it is due.",
  instead of "That time is already taken" or "Kept out of the sleep window".
  A tight deadline reads "Finishes only 29 min before it is due.", and a move
  after Running late no longer says a day was missed.
- Settings shows Look, Accent, Surface, Corners and Blocks only where they do
  something: Today's app, or a design set to Match my look for Look and Accent.
  Elsewhere a line says where that design's colours are.
- Bento's Up next no longer says "No homework added" twice.
- Check for updates no longer sits on "Checking for updates…" for good. GitHub
  refuses unsigned checks past 60 an hour per address, which a school or phone
  network shares, and the app said nothing when it did. The check now falls back
  to the release page, gives up after 15 seconds of silence, and when it cannot
  check, says so with a button to open the release page. A download that stops
  says so in the update dialog.

### Added
- Keep me signed in on this computer, on the sign-in card and on by default.
  The next launch opens the week without signing in until the session ends
  (seven days after sign-in) or you log out. Log out forgets it.
- School hours under More > Adding, for a student who skipped school at setup.
  It opens their School if they have one, and otherwise School filled in as
  Monday to Friday, 08:00 to 14:30.

### Changed
- After a plan, the status line says how many homework blocks were planned.
- The Main view and Day screen menus say what each view is for first:
  Calendar · Today's app, Agenda · Timeline, Dashboard · Bento, Focus · One
  thing, and so on.
- Deadline tags read Plenty of time, Tight and Cutting it close, not Room,
  Limited room and Very little room.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-09-21

### Changed
- Plan my homework and More stay in the top bar in every design, including My day.
  Designs no longer hide them behind a Tools button, and they no longer draw their
  own Plan my week or Go to my day buttons. Add homework stays on the design.
- Settings opens from a gear at the right of the bar. More holds Adding, Planning,
  Advanced (undo, copy, save, restore, reload) and Log out. Account, Availability
  and Check for updates live in Settings. Look, Main view and Day screen share one
  Appearance & layout page. The separate Layout dialog is gone.
- Labels that counted homework sessions now say how many minutes are planned and
  how many of those are done. One thing says how many minutes are left today.
- Running late puts a notice under the top bar: why it cannot run yet, or the
  locked start and whether anything moved. The status line still says the same
  words. "Is now locked" waits until the save has kept it; if that save fails,
  the notice says so instead.
- Spreading homework across days says how much time is ready to add and when it
  is due ("3 h ready to add before Sun 23:59."), not how many sessions.
- Alarm days sit in two rows, Monday to Thursday and Friday to Sunday.
- Settings applies each change as you make it. There is no OK or Cancel, only
  Close, and a line beside it says when a change is saved. Look and layout change
  the window at once; the rest saves a moment after your last change, and
  closing saves anything still waiting. Turning on focus splitting rounds the
  focus lengths to 15 minutes straight away instead of asking when you press OK.
  A Spotify link that is not a share link is not saved, and Settings says why.
  Account and Availability keep their own Save.

### Fixed
- The first-week sport name is an empty field with a placeholder, not the word
  Soccer sitting in it. Times replace their default when you type. A blank sport
  name is saved as Sport or club.
- Every Settings page fits its window at normal and large text. The Appearance &
  layout page had cut off its dropdown arrows and descriptions, Alerts had cut
  off its Test button, and at large text the list of pages cut its own names
  short. Group titles no longer sit on their frame line.
- A setup time is selected only on the click that enters it, so a second click
  puts the cursor inside "08:00" instead of selecting it all again.
- A notice under the top bar stays on one line when it fits and no longer covers
  the bottom of the Day, Week, Month and My day buttons at large text.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-09-20

### Added
- FlexWeek updates itself (2026-09-20). It checks for a newer release at most
  once a day, says what changed, and installs it when you press Update now.
  Nothing installs on its own. A download that does not match the checksum
  published beside it is discarded rather than run, a directory that cannot be
  written is reported rather than half-written, and a tarball is unpacked beside
  the bundle and swapped in, so a failure part way leaves the working app alone.
  Checking can be turned off and a version can be skipped; both settings live on
  the device. **0.13.0 has no updater, so the step to 0.14.0 is the last one you
  download by hand.**
- Day and Month follow the week layout (2026-09-20). Timeline, Mission, Bento,
  Retro and Clay rebuild those tabs in their own furniture. Today's app keeps
  the clock-order Day list and a Month of named chips instead of "2 due /
  3 sessions". My day is unchanged.
- A dark colourway for every design (2026-09-20). Bento gains Midnight and Clay
  gains Dusk, which were light-only. Every design now offers dark, every dark
  colourway passes the same AA check as the rest, and Match my look carries any
  dark pack or preset into any design.
- The week saves itself (2026-09-20), a second and a half after the last change,
  and retries a failed save on its own. It never writes over a week another
  window changed: that conflict is still yours to answer. Save stays under More
  and on Ctrl+S.
- First-week setup after recovery codes (2026-09-20): school hours, one sport,
  then the first homework. Each step can be skipped. Recovery codes sit in the
  same card as sign-in.

### Changed
- Today's app is one row (2026-09-20). Twenty-three buttons of identical weight
  and no title at all is what made it feel cluttered, so this is hierarchy
  rather than deletion: the week you are on is a heading, Previous and Next are
  arrows, Day/Week/Month/My day are one control, and Plan my homework is the one
  filled button. Adding is the calendar and the Add menu; Layout and Log out are
  under More.
- Settings is a left rail: Appearance, Focus, Alerts, This computer. The seven
  look knobs wait behind Fine-tune. Account actions wrap instead of slicing.

### Fixed
- Opening Day did nothing on a real week (2026-09-20). Two sentinels built with
  object() in different functions could never match, so an opaque value was
  stored as a block's start time and sorting those starts raised. The exception
  took down the redraw before it reached the line that switches view, and Qt
  swallowed it, so the button simply looked dead. **This is in 0.13.0.**
- The first-week card was see-through, and the week was drawn through its own
  text (2026-09-20).
- The packaged README no longer offers a web version that does not exist
  (2026-09-20).

### Security
- The Spotify link check refuses nine ways of putting open.spotify.com where a
  substring check would accept it, each with a test (2026-09-20).

## [0.13.0] - 2026-09-20

### Removed
- The web client (2026-09-19). `frontend/` is gone: 11,677 lines of JavaScript,
  CSS and HTML, and 6,982 lines of Node tests. FlexWeek was two clients over one
  backend, kept at parity by hand, and most of the app's half-built controls
  turned out to be the desktop side of a pair whose web side worked. The backend
  serves the API and nothing else, Node has left CI, and `--web-only` is now
  `--backend-only`. **There is no browser way in: FlexWeek is the desktop app.**
- Retired Qt WebEngine desktop shell (2026-09-19). The Chromium window, Linux
  renderer sandbox helper, and leftover probe tests are gone. The look-concepts
  mock-up opens in the system browser.

### Added
- Alarms that make a sound (2026-09-19). The desktop app stored six sound names,
  a volume and a "Play a sound" box, and had no audio in it at all: every alarm
  was a silent dialog. The five tones are synthesised as PCM and played through
  `QAudioSink`, repeating every 2.5 seconds until the alarm is answered. An alarm
  set to Spotify opens its linked track and falls back to a chime if that does
  not open. Audio is best-effort throughout: a machine with no sound card shows
  the alarm in silence rather than failing.
- The alarm editor reaches all of it (2026-09-19). Sound, days and a per-alarm
  Spotify link, an alarm on no days refused because it could never ring, a bad
  link caught where it is typed, and a **Test** button beside the volume.
- A Spotify link on any block (2026-09-19). Both editors have the field the web
  had, so the Spotify button is no longer limited to the default link.
- Focus splitting on the desktop (2026-09-19). "Split long homework into focus
  sessions" works: the solver is asked to reserve the breaks before it runs, and
  each placed block becomes chunks and breaks laid end to end on the day it
  chose. Off-grid timer lengths are caught in Settings with an offer to round.
- Start FlexWeek at login (2026-09-19) writes a real autostart entry, or a Run
  key on Windows. The box shows what this machine will do, not what the account
  remembers.
- Alerts that stay until handled (2026-09-19). The preference was mislabelled
  "Alert even in Do Not Disturb", which the app cannot promise; it now says what
  the web says and does it, in a strip inside the window.
- Category chips carry their category's colour, or the accent when "Colour chips
  with my accent" is on (2026-09-19).
- A plan review panel (2026-09-19). Solve says what moved and why, in the
  solver's own words, instead of dropping one explanation in the status line.

### Fixed
- Day and Month wear the design you picked (2026-09-20). The design was read off
  whichever widget was on screen, so it dressed the week and nothing else and
  the app looked like two programs. The choice now decides the colours wherever
  you are in the planner.
- Signing in is the sign-in screen (2026-09-20). Create account and Sign in sat
  side by side as equals; making an account is now a line of small print that
  switches the card over, and whichever mode is showing owns Return.
- A squeezed dialog no longer slices text in half (2026-09-20). Fields have a
  minimum height at every text size.
- The ringing alarm is 380px wide with buttons you can hit, not 209 (2026-09-19).
- The end-of-session chime answers to its own setting, and focus phase changes
  announce themselves (2026-09-19).
- "Open on: Day" opens on Day (2026-09-19). It was saved and never read.
- Ten preferences the desktop could not set are settable, so it is a peer of the
  account rather than a subset (2026-09-19).
- The week's actions are grouped instead of spilling across two rows
  (2026-09-19). Six buttons stay out; the rest are under More and Tools, built
  from one table so they cannot drift apart. Nothing was removed.
- Every dialog fits a 1366x768 laptop (2026-09-18).
- Three designs get a narrow arrangement at 1150px instead of a sideways scroll
  (2026-09-18).
- Long blocks repeat their name, the month reveals after layout, the dial's week
  strip stays on screen, and no surface speaks in raw timestamps (2026-09-18).
- Bento's tiles close their gap, Clay's cards elide, and Timeline's bars sit in
  a track (2026-09-18).
- The sign-in page has a card, and chrome buttons stop filling the window
  (2026-09-18).
- The window chrome follows whichever design is on screen (2026-09-18).
- The Linux and Windows packages carry what the alarms need (2026-09-20).
  QtMultimedia arrived with dependencies neither bundle check allowed; both
  lists now name them, and a missing one means a silent alarm rather than an app
  that will not start.
- The week grid opens on the current time, not empty dawn (2026-09-19).
- Retro Week.exe stays on the desk, and Saturday and Sunday scroll into view
  (2026-09-19).
- Mission control names skinny bars and elides radar titles (2026-09-19).
- Card tints stay visible against the page, so Terminal Bento load bars
  no longer vanish into black (2026-09-19).

### Security
- The Spotify link check is proven, not assumed (2026-09-20). Nine bypasses that
  put `open.spotify.com` where a substring check would accept it — in userinfo,
  a path segment, a query parameter, a subdomain, plain http, an explicit port,
  a `javascript:` scheme — each have a test showing they are refused.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-09-19

### Added
- Native desktop layouts (2026-09-18, device-only). A layout is a whole way of
  showing the week, where a look is only its colours. **Layout** in the top bar
  picks a main view to plan in (Today's app, Timeline, Mission control, Bento,
  Retro desktop, Clay deck) and a day screen to watch once the plan is made (One
  thing, Day dial). **My day**, or T, opens the day screen; Back to planning, B
  or Escape leaves it. Each design has its own colourways plus *Match my look*,
  and Fine-tune options behind one checkbox. Risk is shown in the solver's own
  words. A design of its own gets the window: the planning controls move into a
  **Tools** menu. Every layout fits 1366 by 768. See Amendment C of
  `docs/stage8-appearance-contract.md`. The web client has no layouts yet, and
  the choice does not sync to the account until the owner approves the fields.
- Native desktop (`python -m desktop.main`, 2026-09-17). Qt widgets talk to the
  same local Python API with no WebEngine and no JavaScript on the default
  path. Create account, recovery codes, sign-in, a dated week, fixed times,
  homework, Solve and Save work. Week, Day and Month share that week; dragging
  empty time adds a block of the armed type, dragging a one-day block moves or
  resizes it, and a repeating commitment refuses the drag so it is not silently
  retimed. Homework keeps the exact due minute, notes, links, a checklist and
  Finished. Undo and Redo walk the last saved change on the week on screen
  (Ctrl+Z). Copy, paste, duplicate and copy-day stay on an internal clipboard
  (Ctrl+C/V/D). Routines, unfinished homework, missed recovery, running late,
  spread and availability talk to the same Stage 3/4 API. Focus timers credit
  homework once when a work phase ends and forget the timer on sign-out.
  Settings round-trip packs, timers, reminders and alarms. Forgotten-password
  recovery, restore points, week/day files and account transfer use the existing
  account APIs. `--smoke-test` walks a native week without Chromium.
  `--database` points at a file for isolated checks.
- Look knobs and presets (2026-09-18, shared frontend and native Qt). Settings
  Look lists the five account packs and the device presets Terminal, Poster,
  Ink, High contrast, Paper and Pastel. Customize still has Surface, Corners,
  Depth, Font, Calendar blocks and Density. Terminal is true black, phosphor,
  amber, monospace; Poster is yellow, navy and dark red with hard shadows and
  large type; Ink is near-monochrome serif with light and dark maps; High
  contrast is black, white and yellow with outlined blocks and large text, and
  it turns on only from this menu. Paper is a warm cream planner page with
  serif type and a sepia accent; Pastel is pink and lavender with pill corners,
  raised panels and a deep orchid accent. Those two are the soft looks, rounded
  and with depth, where the other four are flat and sharp, and both stay light
  over a dark pack. Knobs you set by hand stay when you change Look. All of it
  stays on this computer until the contract amendment is approved.
- Pill corners keep calendar blocks readable (2026-09-17, shared frontend).
  Chips become capsules; a block's corners stop at 8px so a tall School block
  cannot round its own title away.

### Changed
- Packaged Windows and Linux downloads are the native Qt client (2026-09-19).
  Chromium is not compiled into the bundle. The retired WebEngine shell stays
  in source for leftover probe tests.
- Calendar blocks take their category colour through a stylesheet property
  instead of an inline border colour (2026-09-17, shared frontend), so a look
  can decide whether the colour lands on the edge, the outline or nowhere.
  Nothing changes on screen with the default look.
- Unsaved weeks stay as drafts when another week opens (2026-09-18, native).
  The weekday you were on stays selected. Reminders for today still fire if
  you are looking at another week or another page.
- Large text enlarges the More menu (2026-09-18, web and native). Overflow
  actions on the native window sit under More.

### Fixed
- Native week navigation, undo, focus credit and calendar shortcuts (2026-09-18).
  A failed week load no longer leaves the previous week's blocks under the new
  date. Undo after a conflict keeps live focus minutes. W, D, M, T, Delete and
  Ctrl+C/V/D/Z/Y reach the window from the week grid. T opens My day the way W
  opens the week. Day Previous and Next move one day. Recovery Continue is the
  only path off the recovery codes page.
- Tools keeps Copy, Paste and Duplicate when a layout owns the window (2026-09-18).
  Those three sat only in the planning bar, which a design of its own hides.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added
- Theme packs, accent and account motion (2026-09-17, shared frontend and
  backend). Settings and the top bar offer System, Light frost, Dark frost,
  Nocturne and Slate. Customize (hidden on a phone) sets Sky, Gold, Sea or Sand
  and can paint category chips with that accent. Motion Off, Normal and Extra
  follow the account, with a copy left on this device for the sign-in screen.
  Normal fades the calendar in when you switch between Week, Day and Month;
  Extra adds a short rise and pops in the work a plan has just placed. A system
  that asks for reduced motion gets none of it whatever is chosen. Nothing
  frosted is animated, so the Windows flicker has no new way in.
- Accepting a late start draws the new block onto the calendar (2026-09-17,
  shared frontend), so you can see the time you just agreed to arrive instead
  of finding it already there. It draws once, at Normal as well as Extra.

### Changed
- A sidebar type chip is now the whole gesture (2026-09-17, shared frontend).
  Picking School, Homework or any other type opens Add with that type already
  chosen, instead of only arming the calendar. Cancelling leaves the type
  armed, so dragging on the calendar still places it by time.
- Solve, Spread and Running late say what they are doing (2026-09-16, shared
  frontend). Each button now reads "Planning…", "Working out sessions…" or
  "Replanning…" while its request is out, and goes back to its own words
  afterwards. A finished Solve still reads "Update my plan".
- Leaving Month keeps the month you were reading (2026-09-16, shared
  frontend). Pressing Week or Day from Month opens a date inside that month
  rather than the week you happened to come from. If that week cannot be
  loaded, the view stays on Month instead of moving to the wrong dates.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-09-16

0.10.1 landed on `main` as a hotfix and is included in the 0.11.0 installers.
There is no separate `v0.10.1` GitHub release.

### Fixed
- Running late no longer looks like it did nothing (2026-09-16, shared
  frontend). Every reason it refuses to open now appears as a toast as well as
  in the status line, the Preview button explains a week that changed while the
  dialog sat open instead of going quiet, and accepting says what happened,
  including "Nothing had to move." If the replan afterwards fails, the toast
  still confirms the late start was saved.
- Setup cannot blank a half-typed assignment name (2026-09-16, shared
  frontend). Opening the first-week setup while it is already open is now
  ignored, rather than resetting every field back to its default.

### Changed
- Larger date numbers in Month (2026-09-16, shared frontend), on both desktop
  and phone widths.
- A month with deadlines but nothing planned yet says so (2026-09-16, shared
  frontend): "Only one thing is due so far. The rest of the month fills in as
  you plan your work." A single assignment no longer reads as a broken month.
- The collapsed list of work that fit is now called "See the rest of your plan"
  instead of "Why the rest fit" (2026-09-16, shared frontend).
- Setup no longer suggests "Sports" as the name of your sport (2026-09-16,
  shared frontend). The example is now "Soccer, band, karate…".
- Week chrome regrouped (2026-09-16, shared frontend). Hide sidebar moved out
  from between the view switch and the date arrows, the sidebar's Add panel is
  separated from the task list by a rule, and the focus-timer hint is shorter.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed
- Blank notes no longer make a project (2026-09-15, backend). Homework whose
  notes are only spaces or newlines stays an ordinary deadline in Month instead
  of being listed as a project.
- The Month saved-only warning is announced (2026-09-15, shared frontend).
  Screen readers hear it when it appears, and redrawing the month does not
  repeat it.
- Day counted finished work more than once (2026-09-15, backend). A session
  completed on one day no longer adds its minutes to every day it could have
  been done on, so a day's scheduled and focus totals match what actually
  happened. Open work still offers every day it could be done.
- Screen reader gaps in Account settings and transfer (2026-09-15, shared
  frontend). The note about how an account is shared and the recovery-code
  status are announced when they change. The account transfer preview is a
  named region that takes focus when it appears, instead of appearing in
  silence. Logging out or deleting an account moves focus to the log-in or
  create-account screen rather than dropping it on the page.
- Lower date boundary (2026-09-15, shared frontend and backend). The week that
  contains January 1 and 2, 2000 now uses its real Monday, December 27, 1999.
  Week and assignment routes accept only that one pre-2000 week start, so every
  supported calendar date can open in Day view without widening date limits.
- Password-gated account writes (2026-09-15, backend). Replacing recovery
  codes, deleting the account and exporting now verify the current password
  inside the same database transaction as the write, so a password changed
  from another session at the same moment can no longer authorize them.
  `GET /api/month` rejects non-ASCII digits in the month label, and a
  completed session counts only on the day it was completed, not on every
  candidate day.
- Account transfer size (2026-09-15, backend and shared frontend). Export
  refuses with 413 when the compact import apply envelope would exceed the
  256 KiB write cap, so a downloaded file can be posted back. Week count is no
  longer a separate 400-week transfer cap. `GET /api/storage-info` includes
  `transfer_limit_bytes`. The page measures that envelope, not the raw file
  size, so pretty-printed files still import when they fit.

### Added
- Planned study time in Month (2026-09-15, backend and shared frontend). Month
  shows work that is still planned as well as work that is finished. A session
  appears on a date when that date is certain: the day it was completed, or its
  only possible day. Each date says how much of its time is already behind you,
  and study sessions that could still land on several days are reported as one
  total under the calendar instead of being drawn on every one of them.
- Month view (2026-09-15, shared browser and desktop frontend). Students can
  scan a Monday-first calendar for due work, completed deadlines and scheduled
  time, then open a date in Day view. Project rows show study dates, checklist
  progress and the presence of notes or links without displaying private
  details. Overdue work stays separate. Phones use chronological full-width
  date rows, and Month leaves saved Day or Week preferences unchanged.
- Month calendar API (2026-09-15, backend). `GET /api/month?month=YYYY-MM`
  returns a complete-week grid of due dates, placed sessions and locked time,
  plus project and overdue lists, so a Month view can open Day view for a
  date without guessing week boundaries. Unplaced candidate days do not paint
  the month. Year view is still later work. Rules are in
  `docs/stage7-contract.md`.
- Account access and transfer UI (2026-09-15, frontend). New accounts must
  acknowledge their eight one-time recovery codes before first-week setup.
  Students can recover a forgotten password, replace codes, change passwords,
  delete an account, and see the signed-in username, storage mode and server
  origin. Full-account transfer uses a password-gated download and shows weeks,
  homework, routines, settings and named removals before replacing the
  destination. Transfer state and displayed codes are cleared on account
  changes; wrong current-password errors do not end a valid session.
- Account recovery, deletion and local-to-hosted transfer (2026-09-14, backend).
  Registering returns eight one-time recovery codes (hashes only in SQLite).
  `POST /api/auth/recover` sets a new password, drops other sessions and signs
  the student in. Signed-in students can change password, replace unused codes,
  or delete the account with the current password. `GET /api/storage-info` now
  includes username and public origin. `POST /api/account-export` and previewed
  `POST /api/account-import` copy weeks, assignments, preferences and routines
  onto another account after a Stage 3 restore point of the destination
  schedule. Automatic sync is still out of scope. Rules are in the approved
  `docs/stage6-contract.md` and the public API table in `spec.md`.
- Comfort settings UI (2026-09-14, frontend). Settings are grouped into
  Appearance, Focus, Notifications and Account. Students can choose a timer
  preset, preview and explicitly accept 15-minute calendar rounding, test an
  alert at the unsaved volume, enable a quiet focus-transition chime, and read
  the web, desktop, Spotify and duplicate-reminder limits. The preferred view,
  collapsed state and keyboard/pointer-resizable sidebar persist per account;
  phones restore a single-column layout even when the desktop sidebar was
  collapsed. Start-at-login and tray preferences are stored for the Qt shell
  follow-up.
- Comfort settings persistence (2026-09-14, backend). Preferences store alert
  volume, an optional end-of-block chime, tray notification and start-at-login
  flags, preferred week or day view, and sidebar collapsed state and width.
  `POST /api/timer-split-preview` snaps timer lengths to the 15-minute grid and
  returns the split plan without writing. `GET /api/timer-presets` and
  `GET /api/reminder-limits` return the Short/Standard/Long presets and the
  web-versus-desktop reminder copy. Auto-split still requires lengths already
  on the grid. Rules are in `docs/stage5-contract.md`.
- Running late, project spread, protected time and project details
  (2026-09-14, frontend). Running late offers 15, 30 or 60 minutes, previews
  moves and unplaced homework, then stores one locked "Running late" interval
  so reload and Undo see a real change. Spread writes extra sessions in one
  save. Assignments keep notes, links and a checklist. Settings hold protected
  downtime, commute and meal windows, preferred study hours and an optional
  day cutoff. Priority and energy labels describe the stored values without
  changing them, and crowded weeks keep a visible cluster of concrete choices.
- Running late, project spread, assignment notes and protected hours
  (2026-09-14, backend). `POST /api/solve` accepts `running_late` (15, 30 or 60
  minutes from a grid cutoff) as a preview that keeps locked blocks and sleep
  put and leaves overflow in `unplaced`. `POST /api/assignments/{id}/spread`
  previews extra sessions of a chosen length on one assignment before the due
  date. Assignments store notes, http(s) links and a small checklist.
  Preferences store protected downtime, commute and meal windows, preferred
  study hours and an optional day cutoff; solve loads them so the frontend
  does not re-send occupancy. Crowded weeks get one extra explanation with
  concrete choices instead of claiming the week was solved. Rules are in
  `docs/stage4-contract.md`.
- Schedule reuse and recovery (2026-09-14, frontend). Copy, paste, duplicate
  and copy-day use visible controls or Ctrl/Cmd shortcuts and preview fixed-time
  collisions before one atomic save; a retried save reuses its operation id so
  it cannot write twice. Weekly routines capture fixed commitments, apply to the
  chosen weekdays of a destination week and allow one-week holiday or time
  exceptions, with a restore point taken first. Later weeks review unfinished
  homework without changing its assignment id, deadline or progress. Settings
  creates, previews and restores account restore points and says whether they
  are stored on this device or on the FlexWeek server.
- Routines, restore points and storage location (2026-09-14, backend). An
  account can save named weekly templates of fixed commitments, snapshot every
  week and assignment, preview a restore against current data, and restore in
  one transaction that first keeps a recovery point of the schedule being
  replaced. `POST /api/changes` accepts an optional operation id so a retried
  Apply routine or Clear week cannot double-write, and an optional snapshot
  label so those writes take a restore point first. `GET /api/storage-info`
  reports whether this process is local or hosted. Rules are in
  `docs/stage3-contract.md`.
- Day agenda and quick Add homework (2026-09-14, frontend). A Day view sits
  beside Week: Due soon (due today, tomorrow or overdue), Homework today, Fixed
  time and one Next action, with no headings for empty lists and Edit, Finished
  and Start focus in each row. At 800px and narrower Day comes first; wider
  windows start on Week. Add homework asks only for title, due date and time,
  and estimated time, with Choose a time myself for the full editor. The Day
  view shows the day's scheduled, focus and free time from `GET /api/day`. Solve
  is now Plan my homework, or Update my plan once the week has a plan. Results
  list unplaced work first and fold what fits into one line, deadlines at risk
  read "due Tuesday" or "9 days left", and Export and Import moved into
  Settings.
- Day agenda API (2026-09-13, backend). `GET /api/day?date=` returns due-soon
  homework, that day's sessions and fixed blocks, one next action, and
  scheduled / focus / available minutes. Rules are in `docs/stage2-contract.md`.
- Assignments (2026-09-13, backend). Homework is account-owned, with an exact
  local due time, a total estimate, focus progress and its own revision. A
  week holds work sessions that point at an assignment. GET/PUT/DELETE
  `/api/assignments` and POST `/api/changes` land with the week save rules in
  `docs/stage1-contract.md`. Old weekday `latest` values migrate on start and
  are still accepted on saves.
- Homework due dates (2026-09-13, frontend). Adding homework asks for a due
  date and time instead of a weekday, and the date may be in a later week.
  Each homework is saved as an assignment together with its session in the
  week, and the card shows the full due date. Focus sessions add their minutes
  to the homework and never mark it done; marking the session done finishes
  the homework. Solve sends the week on screen so due dates become bounds.
- Continuing (2026-09-13, frontend). The sidebar lists homework due this week
  or later that still needs time no session covers, with its due date. Plan
  the rest here adds a session for that time on the days up to the due date,
  and a week that already holds 100 blocks refuses with a plain message.
  Weeks before this one and homework already past due list nothing.
- Focus session choices (2026-09-13, frontend). When a homework focus session
  ends, the student picks Finished (the homework is done and the session keeps
  its slot, saved together), Need more time (adds 15-minute steps to its total
  and starts the break) or Take a break. The timer keeps running across weeks
  and survives a reload of the same account through sessionStorage, which
  holds only ids and times; a session that ran out while the page was closed
  is counted and asks the same question. Starting another timer asks first,
  logging out or signing in as another account clears it, and Quick focus
  times work that is not on the calendar without crediting anything.
- Undo and redo (2026-09-13, frontend). The last 50 changes to weeks and
  homework can be undone and redone with the Undo and Redo buttons beside the
  status line, Ctrl/Cmd+Z, and Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Z or Ctrl+Y, but not while
  typing in a field. Undo saves through the normal revision checks, never
  takes away focus minutes, and stops at a 409 with the usual reload actions;
  a step for a week another device changed since is skipped. Repeating blocks
  say "Remove Tuesday only" or "Delete all days", deleting homework asks
  whether to remove this session or the whole homework, and Clear week moved
  into a More menu. History is cleared on sign-out and account change.
- Export format 2 (2026-09-13, frontend). Week and day exports, and the
  unsaved-week download, carry the homework their sessions point at. Import
  reads formats 1 and 2. Homework is reused only when its id, title and due all
  match; otherwise it gets the backend migration's id for the destination week,
  so importing a file into the same week twice adds nothing and into another
  week adds separate homework. A format 1 file's weekday deadlines become
  homework when saved, and the week reloads to show it.
- Hybrid frost look (2026-09-10) in light and dark. The page sits on a soft
  gradient; the header, week bar, sidebar, sign-in card and dialogs are frosted
  glass with hairline borders; task cards and forms are more solid; the week
  grid and its blocks stay nearly opaque so they remain easy to scan. Buttons
  and focus rings use a soft blue that is kept apart from the category colors.
- Figtree, a friendly geometric typeface, ships with the app (SIL Open Font
  License, `frontend/fonts/`), so the desktop app needs no internet for fonts.
- Small duotone icons on Settings, Log out, Solve, week navigation, export and
  import, and the sidebar headings.
- First-open downloads (2026-09-10). GitHub Releases and the README lead with
  Download for Windows and Download for Linux. Each archive includes a README
  that names glibc 2.38, a normal desktop with OpenGL or EGL, and SmartScreen
  on Windows. Checksums sit next to the downloads. Chromebooks are pointed at
  the web version when it exists.
- Linux archive extras: README, icon, `.desktop` file, menu-entry script, and
  vendored libxcb-cursor. Unused Qt translations are dropped.
- First-week setup (2026-09-10). A new account is asked for school days and
  hours, one sport or practice, and the first homework, then Solve runs. Every
  step can be skipped. An empty week shows a Set up my week banner.
- Add dialog (2026-09-10). Dragging or clicking empty calendar space opens a
  dialog on that time range instead of adding a block at once. The sidebar now
  holds type chips (School, Homework, Study, Sports and more) with a hint for
  the chosen type, plus Add without dragging.
- Desktop: launching FlexWeek again while it runs brings the open window
  forward instead of starting a second copy (2026-09-10).
- Focus timers. Start a pomodoro on a task the solver has placed, then pause,
  skip or reset it. Sessions and minutes are kept on the task and survive a save.
- Alarms you set yourself, separate from your schedule. They live in
  preferences and pop up until you dismiss or snooze them.
- Spotify share links on blocks and alarms, and a Now / Next line showing what
  is running and what comes after it.
- Linux desktop release archive rebuilt from `f12ea5c`, with the extracted
  executable verified against its bundled health endpoint and web UI
  (2026-09-09).
- Repeatable full-source verification command, web CI workflow, a feature
  coverage guide, generated solver invariants and real calendar/completion
  WebEngine regression checks (2026-09-08).
- Multi-day locked blocks open with Edit this day vs Entire series: occurrence
  edits can remove one weekday or split a changed day into its own block; series
  edits still change every weekday together. Context menu mirrors those choices.
- Start reminders: preferences for enable, lead minutes and sound. While the tab
  is open, FlexWeek polls due starts (Daily Scheduler start-alert math), shows an
  in-app toast, and uses the Notification API when permitted. Desktop system-tray
  alerts are deferred (no new tray dependency in this slice).
- Category chips in the editor and a sidebar legend (School, Study, Homework,
  Sports, Activity, Meals, Sleep, Free) with stronger grid colors.
- Per-block completed flag with form checkbox and context toggle; survives
  save/reload.
- Export current week as JSON (Shift-click for plain text) and import a
  FlexWeek JSON week/day file into the matching week without touching other
  weeks. Context menu can export one day as JSON.
- Week grid drag interactions: empty drag creates a locked block on the 15-minute
  grid, click-empty creates a 60-minute block clipped to the next block, drag body
  moves, edge resize, click selects, double-click opens the editor, and a context
  menu offers Edit/Delete. Changes use the existing dirty/save path.
- Optional activity category with a thin color palette (School, Study, Homework,
  Sports, Activity, Meals, Free); older weeks without a category still load.

### Changed
- The README shows the app (2026-09-11): a solved week in light at the top, and
  the first-week setup and the dark theme under Screenshots. The images in
  `docs/images/` are captured from the real app with a demo week.
- Windows downloads are installers, 0.9.2 (2026-09-11). The zip is gone.
  `FlexWeek-Windows-x64-Setup.exe` (Inno Setup) installs for the current
  account without an administrator, with a Start menu shortcut, an optional
  desktop shortcut and an uninstaller. `FlexWeek-Windows-x64.msi` (WiX)
  installs for every account in Program Files, for schools and IT. The release
  workflow installs each one, opens the app through its Start menu shortcut
  with the setup-Solve smoke test, and uninstalls it before attaching the files.
  Pull requests that touch packaging run the same build and tests.
- Theme now defaults to System (2026-09-10): FlexWeek follows the device's
  light or dark setting and switches when that setting changes. Choosing Light
  or Dark in the header or Settings keeps that theme. New accounts and
  signed-out screens start on System. The menus say System, Light and Dark;
  saved values `slate` and `nocturne` are unchanged, so existing accounts keep
  their choice, and older databases upgrade automatically on start.
- Selection outlines, the Now / Next line, Focus timer controls, slack badges
  and the reminder toast use theme colors instead of fixed yellow, lime and
  amber (2026-09-10).
- When the system asks for reduced transparency or more contrast, or blur is
  unavailable, frosted panels turn solid instead (2026-09-10).
- Create account and Log in are separate screens (2026-09-10). Create account
  is shown first; logging out opens Log in. The app says Log in and Log out.
- Locked and flexible are labeled Fixed time and Flexible, each with a one-line
  explanation (2026-09-10). Repeat days, priority, energy, course, Spotify and
  Completed are under More options. A flexible task states which days Solve
  may use and when it is due.
- School starts at 08:00–14:30 Monday to Friday and homework at 1 hour when
  added without dragging. Time needed is chosen from a list instead of typed
  in minutes (2026-09-10).
- For the current week, a new flexible task may use today onward, not days
  that are already over (2026-09-10).
- After Solve, badges read Tight fit or At risk, and tasks with room to spare
  get none. Results open with a sentence such as "Placed 2 of 3 tasks." The
  Focus timer section appears only once a task has a time. Now / Next is one
  line in the week bar (2026-09-10).

### Fixed
- Windows, 0.9.2 (2026-09-11): the `FlexWeek.lnk` shortcut in the 0.9.0 and
  0.9.1 zip pointed at `C:\dist\zip-stage\FlexWeek\app\FlexWeek.exe`, a folder
  on the build machine, because the workflow created it with a relative path.
  The installers replace it with shortcuts made on the user's PC.
- Desktop, 0.9.1 (2026-09-11): after first-week setup, "Add to my week and
  Solve" could leave a blank white window with no message and no way back.
  That is what Qt shows when the page's renderer process stops, and the window
  did not handle it. FlexWeek now reopens the page with solid panels instead of
  frosted glass, signs back in and runs Solve again, so the placed homework and
  What Solve did return with a status line saying so. If the page stops again
  within a minute, a native panel offers Reload instead of reloading in a loop.
  The exact trigger on the testers' machines was not reproduced here.
- Release checks, 0.9.1 (2026-09-11): `FlexWeek --smoke-test` now walks a
  throwaway account through setup to its first Solve and fails when the window
  grab is blank, on the Linux tarball, the Linux onedir and the Windows build.
  It used to stop at the Create account screen.
- The AppImage checksum named the build machine's path
  (`/home/runner/work/...`), so `sha256sum -c` failed next to the download. It
  now names only the file, like the tarball's, and the release workflow checks
  both (2026-09-11).
- Download notes (2026-09-11): the README and release text say what to do when
  the AppImage will not start for lack of FUSE (`--appimage-extract`, then
  `squashfs-root/AppRun`, or use the tarball). The Windows README, README and
  release text say to double-click the FlexWeek shortcut, not files inside
  `app/`; the old text still said to open FlexWeek.exe.
- The editor no longer saves a task with no days, or a task due before every
  day it may use. It keeps the dialog open and names the problem (2026-09-10).
- Desktop: the tray icon was missing from the packaged app, so closing the
  window left FlexWeek running with no window and no way back. The icon now
  loads, the first close explains that FlexWeek is still in the tray, and
  closing quits when no tray icon is visible (2026-09-10).
- The Keep alerts visible until handled setting now keeps desktop tray alerts
  until you click them. Unchecked alerts still disappear after ten seconds.
- Skip, pause, or a second complete during a focus-session save no longer
  double-counts that cycle.
- Import and week save refuse a pomodoro parent together with the chunks split
  from it, so the same hours cannot hold both the original task and its pieces.
- Cancelled calendar gestures no longer save, and secondary pointers cannot
  finish another pointer's gesture (2026-09-08).
- Signing out clears private reminder alerts. Delayed preference responses and
  file reads cannot change the next account. Today's loaded reminders continue
  while browsing a different week (2026-09-08).
- Signing out also closes live browser notifications, solved flexible tasks can
  trigger reminders, and suspended drafts remain isolated by account (2026-09-09).
- Legacy and day imports validate starts and scheduling bounds before changing
  the week, including the resulting merged size and occurrence-ID collisions.
  Valid unusual IDs survive import, and downloaded drafts use the importable
  export format (2026-09-08).
- Saving an unchanged occurrence keeps its recurring series intact (2026-09-08).
- Completing through the menu or editor retains the task's solved placement
  as spent time without losing its candidate days. Day and text exports follow
  the visible solved placement, and ambiguous day imports cannot duplicate a
  multi-day flexible assignment (2026-09-09).
- Exam preparation wins contested capacity even when a lower-priority reading
  task has fewer possible placements. The solver first looks for a complete
  schedule before exploring optional omissions, avoiding a reproduced timeout
  on a feasible energy-sensitive week (2026-09-09).
- A task you finished but left listed on several possible days no longer blocks
  that hour on every one of them. It was one piece of work done once, and it
  could push three real tasks off the week. A finished task that was actually
  placed on a day still holds that time, because you really did use it.
- When finished work is what fills a slot, FlexWeek says so instead of telling
  you the time is taken by school, sports or sleep.
- A task you have ticked off no longer competes for a slot. Finished work used
  to be scheduled again, so a completed essay could take the last free hour and
  FlexWeek would tell you your real homework did not fit because a
  higher-priority task took the slot. A finished task that already had a time
  keeps it; one that never had a time is simply left alone.
- A damaged or unrecognised export file is refused with a reason, and the week
  on screen is left exactly as it was. Previously the file was written into your
  week and drawn on the grid before the save failed, so a bad file could wipe
  what was there. Files from a newer version of FlexWeek are refused too.
- Dragging a single day of a repeating block no longer silently retimes every
  other day of it. The drag is refused and FlexWeek points you at Edit
  occurrence or Edit series, which is how every other change to a repeating
  block already works. One-off blocks still drag and resize normally.
- Importing a week now stops without changing the open week when the target
  week cannot be loaded. Day-file imports preserve the other occurrences of a
  repeating block, including when the same file is imported again.
- Desktop new-window links no longer leave hidden browser pages running; only
  HTTP(S) external links are sent to the system browser (2026-09-07).
- Desktop users can save an unsaved draft through a native file dialog.

### Added
- Scheduling explanations now use student-facing messages, can highlight the
  affected task, and show ok/tight/danger deadline slack on placed tasks.
- A solved week can recover from one missed weekday occurrence of a locked
  block. FlexWeek keeps the missed occurrence in the saved week, re-solves the
  remaining tasks, lists time and day changes, and lets the user restore it.
- Dated weeks. Your schedule is now kept per calendar week instead of as one
  rolling week, with Previous, Next and Today controls, the date shown on each
  day header, and a picker listing the weeks you have saved. Each week keeps
  its own unsaved edits, so moving between weeks never loses work and never
  copies one week's blocks into another.
- `GET /api/weeks` lists the weeks an account has saved, so a week you did not
  know about is still reachable.
- Windows standalone build script and isolated real-WebEngine account, link and
  offline-draft tests (2026-09-07); Windows execution remains unverified.
- Linux desktop app: a PySide6 web-engine window with the FlexWeek backend
  bundled in, so it runs with no separate server and no Python installed. It
  starts its own backend on a loopback port and keeps its database in your user
  data directory. A persistent profile means a sign-in survives restarting the
  app; there is a retry screen if the backend cannot be reached, and external
  links open in the system browser. Build with `desktop/build_linux.sh`.
  Point it at a hosted deployment with `FLEXWEEK_DESKTOP_ORIGIN`.
- Desktop packaging recommendation: PySide6 web-engine shell around the hosted
  app (`DESKTOP.md`).
- 2026-09-07: Username/password accounts, expiring sessions, account-owned SQLite
  weeks and saved Nocturne/Slate themes adapted from Daily Scheduler.
- Save retry, revision-conflict handling, unsaved draft download and explicit
  import of legacy browser weeks; same-account draft restoration after expiry.
- Basic request protection, authentication throttling and bounded input.
- Account/API and frontend state tests.
- Add / edit / delete forms for locked blocks and flexible tasks.
- Last week saved in the browser; a corrupt save resets to a demo.
- Constraint solver: backtracking with MRV and forward checking, 150 ms cap.
- Solve button and a debug panel (`solve_ms`, placed count, unplaced titles).
- Placed flexible tasks painted on the week grid.
- App logo and favicon, cropped from `FlexWeek.png` (lime phone + dumbbell).
- Partner-style demo weeks: Alex and Jordan each have 4 locked blocks and 8
  flexible tasks.
- 15-minute tick marks on the week grid, duration labels on locked blocks, and
  due/course pills on flexible tasks.

### Changed
- Existing accounts are migrated on first start: the one saved week becomes the
  week containing that day, keeping its blocks and its revision.
- An unsaved-draft download is now named for its week and carries the week in
  its JSON, so drafts from two weeks are no longer indistinguishable files.
- "New week" and the legacy-import confirmation now name the week on screen
  instead of saying "your current week".
- Linux builds preserve previous artifacts and use separate staging directories.
- 2026-09-06: Revise the post-Phase-3 roadmap for accounts, app/web delivery,
  Daily Scheduler interactions and themes, with design and audits deferred.
- Week grid colors follow the logo (paper gray, lime, dark teal) instead of a
  generic dark dashboard.
- Slot starts are the half-open range `[06:00, 23:00)`; `23:00` is not a legal
  start.

### Removed
- `grok-desktop-prompt.md` after the desktop packaging recommendation landed.
- Product demo picker/endpoints and anonymous localStorage saving. Seed schedules
  remain test fixtures.
- `backend/tests/test_models.py`, which still imported the pre-Pydantic
  dataclass API and broke collection.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-06

### Added
- Pydantic `TimeBlock`, `Move`, `SolveTrace` in `backend/models.py`.
- 15-minute slot helpers in `backend/slots.py`.
- FastAPI app serving `frontend/` plus `GET /api/demos/{name}` and a stub
  `POST /api/solve`.
- Week grid UI with a demo switcher.
