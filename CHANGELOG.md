# Changelog

All notable changes to FlexWeek are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- App logo and favicon, cropped from `FlexWeek.png` (lime phone + dumbbell).
- Partner-style demo weeks: Alex and Jordan each have 4 locked blocks and 8
  flexible tasks.
- 15-minute tick marks on the week grid, duration labels on locked blocks, and
  due/course pills on flexible tasks.

### Changed
- Week grid colors follow the logo (paper gray, lime, dark teal) instead of a
  generic dark dashboard.
- Slot starts are the half-open range `[06:00, 23:00)`; `23:00` is not a legal
  start.

### Removed
- `backend/tests/test_models.py`, which still imported the pre-Pydantic
  dataclass API and broke collection.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-06

### Added
- Pydantic `TimeBlock`, `Move`, `SolveTrace` in `backend/models.py`.
- 15-minute slot helpers in `backend/slots.py`.
- FastAPI app serving `frontend/` plus `GET /api/demos/{name}` and a stub
  `POST /api/solve`.
- Week grid UI with a demo switcher.
- `PHASES.md` contest calendar.
