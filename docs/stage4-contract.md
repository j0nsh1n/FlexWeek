# Contract: Stage 4 — adapt plans to real student days

Status: approved 2026-09-15 by the owner. Claude owns the browser/desktop frontend. Grok owns
persistence, the solver, and authenticated API work. Both clients continue to
use the same HTML, CSS and JavaScript frontend.

This contract is based on `claude/stage3-frontend` at `9759a23`. It does not
port Daily Scheduler's AI tool execution, and it does not drop work that no
longer fits.

## Goal

A student can spread a project's hours across days before the due time, run
late by 15, 30 or 60 minutes and preview the revised plan, keep notes and a
small checklist on the assignment, and protect downtime so the solver does not
treat every gap as homework time.

## Owner decisions (proposed defaults)

1. **Running late** is a solve preview, like missed-block recovery. Accepting it
   writes one one-off locked block titled "Running late" for the occupied
   interval through `/api/changes`, then re-solves. That stored interval is what
   reload and Undo see. Undo of an accepted replan is one frontend Undo entry,
   already Stage 1.
2. Delay choices are **15, 30 and 60 minutes** only.
3. The cutoff is an explicit `from_start` on the 15-minute grid. The frontend
   supplies "now" snapped down to a slot when the day is today.
4. Fixed commitments and sleep stay put. Flexible work that no longer fits
   remains in `unplaced` with its usual reason. Nothing is deleted.
5. **Spread** creates extra flexible sessions of the chosen length on the same
   assignment. It does not place start times and is not pomodoro splitting.
6. Spread is a **preview**. Confirmation writes sessions through `/api/changes`.
7. Assignment **notes, links and checklist** live on the assignment, not on
   sessions. Empty values are omitted from stored JSON the same way optional
   TimeBlock fields are.
8. Protected downtime, commute/meal buffers and a day cutoff live on
   **preferences**, so they apply every week without painting extra blocks.
   Preferred study hours are a soft placement preference, like energy.
9. No new reason code is required for cluster advice. It is an explanation with
   `reason: null`. Running late reshuffles reuse `RESHUFFLE_AFTER_MISS` with a
   distinct sentence in that path only.

## 1. Running late

`POST /api/solve` accepts `running_late` instead of `recover` (not both):

```json
{
  "blocks": [],
  "week_start": "2026-09-14",
  "running_late": {
    "day": 0,
    "minutes": 30,
    "from_start": "14:30",
    "previous_placed": []
  }
}
```

- `day` is 0–6 in that week. `from_start` is HH:MM on a 15-minute slot in
  06:00–22:45. Occupancy is `[from_start, from_start + minutes)` clipped to
  23:00, on that day only.
- That occupancy is extra locked time. School, sport and sleep blocks are
  unchanged. Sleep 23:00–06:00 stays a hard guard.
- The solver re-places incomplete flexible work. Moves vs `previous_placed`
  use the same reshape as missed-block recovery. Work that cannot fit is
  unplaced, never dropped from the week payload.
- Invalid combinations return 422. Solve still does not mutate storage.
- Accepting the preview does not send `running_late` again. It stores the
  occupied interval as a locked block (`title` "Running late", one day, start
  and duration on the grid, clipped so it ends by 23:00) alongside every
  existing block, using a stable `operation_id`. A later solve treats that
  block as ordinary locked time.

## 2. Spread a project

`POST /api/assignments/{id}/spread` is authenticated and CSRF-protected. It
does not write:

```json
{"session_min": 60, "from_date": "2026-09-14"}
```

`session_min` is 15–180 and a multiple of 15. `from_date` is YYYY-MM-DD.

Response:

```json
{
  "assignment_id": "hw-essay",
  "session_min": 60,
  "remaining_min": 0,
  "sessions": [
    {"week_start": "2026-09-14", "date": "2026-09-14", "days": [0], "duration_min": 60}
  ]
}
```

Rules:

- Remaining minutes are `unplanned_minutes(estimate, focus, planned open
  sessions)`, the Stage 1/3 quantity. Completed assignments return 422.
- Sessions round-robin across calendar dates from `from_date` through the due
  date inclusive. Dates after the due date are unused.
- Chunks are `session_min` until the remainder, which is also a multiple of 15.
  This is not a pomodoro parent/chunk split: each session is a normal flexible
  block with `assignment_id` and no `pomodoro_*` fields.
- The preview does not assign block ids or start times. The frontend supplies
  ids when it confirms through `/api/changes`.
- A week that would exceed 100 blocks after confirm is rejected by the existing
  week validator, not by this preview.

## 3. Assignment notes, links and checklist

On `AssignmentContent`:

- `notes`: at most 4000 characters. Default empty and omitted when empty.
- `links`: at most 20 `{label, url}` pairs. Label 1–80 characters. URL is an
  `http` or `https` URL at most 500 characters, no userinfo.
- `checklist`: at most 40 `{id, text, done}` items. Ids unique within the
  assignment, 1–80 characters. Text 1–80 characters. `done` defaults false.

Checklist completion does not complete the assignment. Focus minutes still
never complete anything.

## 4. Protected time and study hours

On preferences (defaults omitted when empty, so existing clients keep working):

- `protected`: at most 21 windows `{kind, days, start, duration_min}` where
  `kind` is `downtime`, `commute` or `meal`. Days unique 0–6. Start and
  duration on the 15-minute grid, fitting 06:00–23:00.
- `study_windows`: at most 21 windows `{days, start, duration_min}` with the
  same grid rules. Soft preference only.
- `day_cutoff`: HH:MM on the grid, 06:15–23:00, or omitted. Flexible work must
  finish by that time every day.

`POST /api/solve` loads the signed-in account's preferences and applies them.
The frontend does not re-send occupancy. Packed-fixture `solve_ms < 150`
remains required.

## 5. Deadline-cluster explanations

When two or more incomplete flexible tasks are unplaced or have danger slack,
the trace includes one extra explanation (`reason` null) naming concrete
choices: shorten a session, pick another day, or adjust availability. It must
not claim the solver made an impossible week fit.

## Out of scope

- Frontend UI, copy, and Undo wiring (Claude).
- Dropping blocks that no longer fit.
- Daily Scheduler AI tools, Google Calendar, LMS import.
- Changing sleep, accounts, restore points, or routines.
- Spec.md edits until the owner approves this contract.

## Verification (backend)

- Solver fixtures: late occupancy does not move locked blocks or sleep; overflow
  is unplaced; packed fixture stays under 150 ms with protected hours.
- Spread: remaining minutes, due-date bounds, 15-minute chunks, same
  `assignment_id`, no pomodoro fields.
- Assignment PUT round-trip for notes/links/checklist; rejected javascript:
  URLs and duplicate checklist ids.
- Preferences reject overlapping-the-grid protected windows; solve honors
  cutoff.
- Cluster explanation appears only when two or more tasks are in trouble.
- Account isolation: another account's assignment spread is 404.
- `.venv/bin/python scripts/verify.py --web-only` from this worktree.
