# Verification

Run the source checks from the repository root with the existing Python 3.14
environment:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/verify.py
```

The command runs Ruff, mypy, all pytest cases, and working, staged and
committed-range diff whitespace checks. A failed command, timeout, missing
desktop dependency, empty test suite or skipped test makes it fail. It installs
nothing and does not build or publish a binary. Qt cases use temporary databases
and offscreen native widgets.

For environments without the desktop dependencies:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/verify.py --backend-only
```

This runs the backend checks and explicitly reports desktop as unverified.
`.github/workflows/verify.yml` runs this variant on pushes and pull requests
using Python 3.14. The workflow has read-only repository permissions. Its hosted
execution is unverified until the branch is pushed.
`.github/workflows/codeql.yml` scans Python; it does not replace this gate. The
generic kit CI that ran pyright is not used.

The generated solver cases use 20 fixed seeds and independent integer-minute
arithmetic. They check purity, candidate days, grid/deadline bounds, occupied
slots, completed work and explanations. They are not an exhaustive proof of
search optimality or a performance benchmark.

Native widget tests drive the Qt window against the real API and reload from
SQLite. Synthetic
pointer events test event wiring but do not prove hardware pointer capture,
touch scrolling or OS notification delivery.

## Adding coverage with a feature

1. Identify the behavior in the map and write a case with a concrete input and
   independently determined output. A fixture captured from current output
   cannot establish that the output is correct.
2. Cover the successful action and its relevant failure boundary. Examples
   include a cancelled gesture, rejected import, failed save, account change or
   exhausted scheduling window.
3. For event-driven UI behavior, extend a native widget case. The integration
   result can include a save and reload so the check covers persistence as well
   as the displayed draft.
   For multi-request actions, also prove retry idempotency: preserve the
   operation key and payload across a failed or ambiguous attempt, then start a
   new operation only after success or an explicit user change.
4. Demonstrate the test failing for the intended defect before fixing it, or
   temporarily remove the behavior in an isolated copy. Inspect the assertion
   mismatch; a missing dependency or syntax exception proves nothing about the
   behavior.
5. Run the full command above. The test glob and pytest discovery pick up new
   tests automatically. Update this map when a new feature needs a new testing
   layer, and record remaining limitations with the handoff.

## Release checks outside the source gate

The full source gate is not a release certification. A packaged Linux build
needs the same create/save/reload and recovery paths exercised through the
packaged executable in a fresh profile. `DESKTOP.md` describes the build and
artifact checks. Windows execution, Safari/iPhone, physical touch, keyboard
accessibility, notification permission/sound and visual contrast remain separate
checks. Native widget tests cover close-to-tray in a source checkout, but the tray icon path
is only proven in the packaged build, because that bug never occurred in a source checkout.

No hosted security audit or production configuration check runs here. Existing
account tests prove their particular isolation/CSRF/revision cases, not the
safety of every deployment.

## Stage 3 evidence

`desktop/tests/test_reuse.py` covers fixed-block collision previews, occurrence and series scope,
day-copy exclusions, homework identity and a remaining-time cap shared across a
batch, keyboard shortcuts that stay off in form fields and behind open dialogs,
routine weekday selection and long routine names, restore-token refresh, the
week kept after a restore, Clear week rollback, and operation ids that repeat
after an unknown response but not after a 409.

Native widget tests in `test_reuse.py` and `test_history.py` drive the same
APIs from the Qt window: copy through a collision preview, routines, unfinished
homework, and restore points. Backend isolation, limits and transactions are in
`test_routines_api.py` and `test_restore_api.py`.

## Findings from the September 8–9 pass

The regression cases reproduced and now protect against:

- Cancelled pointer gestures creating or changing blocks.
- In-page and browser notifications surviving sign-out, solved flexible tasks
  receiving no reminders, and an identical reminder being suppressed in the next account.
- Legacy imports accepting invalid starts or scheduling bounds; day merges
  exceeding the 100-block limit; invalid day envelopes; valid IDs such as
  `__proto__` being rejected, and maximum-length/Unicode IDs drifting from the API.
- A file read crossing an account change and replacing the next account's week.
- A delayed preference response changing the next account's theme.
- Unimportable downloaded drafts.
- Completing a solved task discarding either its spent slot or its original
  candidate days. The persisted completed day now round-trips independently;
  native completion tests cover save/reload/solve.
- A day import duplicating a multi-day flexible assignment, and text/day export
  disagreeing with the placement visible after Solve.
- A second account login discarding the first account's suspended draft.
- Viewing another week silencing reminders for today's loaded week.
- Saving unchanged occurrence fields unnecessarily splitting a recurring block.
- Lower-priority reading beating exam preparation because its placement domain
  was smaller, followed by optional skip branches exhausting the solver budget
  on a feasible energy-sensitive week.

The source findings and platform limitations remaining after review are recorded
in `context.md`. Test totals come from the command output, not a fixed expected
count in this document. The solver timeout test uses a controlled clock to
confirm that budget expiry retains a partial placement and explains unplaced
work; the existing packed-week test checks real elapsed time.
