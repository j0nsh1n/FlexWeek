# context.md — FlexWeek

## Current State
- 2026-10-10: v0.19.1 on `release/0.19.1` (same worktree and venv as 0.19.0): J19, the Add fixed time
  sheet built ahead while idle (`_block_spare`, one account and one look, dropped on either change;
  editing a block still builds on demand); the sign-in card holds its height only while its page
  shows (`_pin_auth_height` on the stack's `currentChanged`), so a hidden sign-in page no longer sets
  every window's least height; Month's tight row is exactly one chip line (#28 at 1024x640).
- 2026-10-10: v0.19.0 released from `release/0.19.0` (worktree `~/.worktrees/flexweek-0190`, `.venv` is
  `venv-0190`): the QA handoff's remaining Fix first items and the Codex audit of 0.18.5. School and
  Setup's activities are a standing week in the store (`standing_blocks`, one row per Setup id and
  the week it stands from; `/api/changes` takes `standing`; restore points and exports carry it);
  unfinished homework from earlier weeks shows in More and after Plan; work due after Sunday gets a
  fair share of this week (`desk/planning.rs` `fair_share`); a time already past is refused (engine
  `past_problem`); the Undo toast stays at least 10 s and pauses under the pointer; Text size is its own
  setting in every look; segmented choices are radio buttons for screen readers; account errors sit
  under their fields; a folded week list for screen readers (Ctrl+Shift+L); 3:1 control edges; the
  focus phase keeps its own work length in the engine (`workMin`). Audit findings 1, 3-11 fixed; 2
  (revision reuse after restore/import) waits for the 1.0 sync store. Built by five lane worktrees
  (Opus, Grok 4.7, GPT-6 Luna, Sonnet, Haiku) and an audit-fix lane, merged and checked by Claude.
- Tests that pick a day of the current week on the real clock can fail on later weekdays since item
  2: hold the clock (`grid_support.hold_clock`, `session.now_ms`).
- Since 0.18.5: new accounts start on a 12-hour clock (the desktop conftest sets 24-hour per test
  unless a test chooses); tests fail on any error inside a Qt slot (`no_error_is_lost_inside_a_qt_slot`).
- Probing motion: `~/.flexweek-ui-harness/scratch/0.18.4/j14/claude-r3/probe_noprof.py` (copy into
  `desktop/tests/` as `test_zz_*.py`, run through fwtest with `-s`; `PROBE_DRAIN=1` waits for
  Settings' design previews, which otherwise land in the timed window; `PROBE_NOPROF=1` for real
  times). On-screen frames: `scratch/0.18.4/j15/clay_frames.py`.
- Rust (`engine/`, contract `docs/engine/contract.md`, wrappers `docs/engine/adapters.md`): the
  planner and solver, slots, weeks, day, month, explain, restore, recovery codes, the store's SQL
  helpers and database connection, and the desktop's Qt-free logic (`desk`: calendar, custom looks
  with saving, naming and import, files, focus, history, pomodoro, remind, reuse, tokens, update,
  week model). Python calls it through the `flexweek_engine` module; the Python wrappers only
  encode, call and decode.
- Python: the FastAPI routes (about 40 SQL statements remain in the route bodies of `create_app`),
  password hashing's random salt, the clock, the environment and file reads (the engine core is
  pure), the pydantic checks, `backend/models.py`'s Spotify and due-date copies, the `CATEGORIES`
  table in `calendar.py`, `TYPE_PT` in `tokens.py`, `custom_look.readability`, all Qt drawing, and
  `scripts/rig/drive.py`.
- Tests: 396 Rust engine tests (engine, store and bindings; clippy and fmt clean). The Python gate on
  `release/0.18.1`: 2790 passed in 7 min 8 s (`fwtest gate --workers 4`). The differential tests and
  the frozen Python copies are deleted; the Python tests that remain guard Python-only code and the
  interface.
- Speed (`log.tsv`, pr35 review at 2e2f76a): placing the probe week 1.1 ms (0.17.2: 2.9 ms; with a
  busy second thread 1.0 ms against 8.0). Drawing a frame of the hours 10.2 ms median (0.17.2:
  9.1 ms; the limit is 16 ms).
- Known differences from the Python originals: integers past 64 bits and JSON only Python reads
  (NaN, lone surrogates) in stored rows; an assignment estimate past 2^63 raises `OverflowError` in
  the engine where Python returned a number (seen once under hypothesis); `build_month` returns a
  month where Python raised `TypeError` on a finished session with no start.
- 0.18.1 plumbing done on `release/0.18.1`: the Bell teardown, the three adapter tests, the
  `today.json` baseline and the deletion of the differential tests, `desk_ref/` and
  `backend/tests/engine_ref/`. About 100 cases those tests pinned have no Rust test of the same case
  (list in the scratch report); `hypothesis` is now used by no test and awaits Jonathan's word to go.
- spec.md drift: its CI desk step says "the desk parity files and the wrapper modules' tests"; it now
  runs the parity files plus `test_tokens.py` and `test_update.py`.

## Domain Model
SQLite: users → sessions, many dated weeks keyed (user_id, week_start), one preference row. Default
desktop mode uses a local per-user database; hosted mode uses the configured deployment. There is no
automatic synchronization between them. Only the engine opens the database; the format is unchanged
from 0.17.2, so earlier passwords, sessions and recovery codes still work.
Assignments are keyed (user_id, id) with a JSON body and revision. A flexible block with
`assignment_id` is a work session of that assignment. Routines are keyed (user_id, id) as named
templates of locked blocks. Restore points snapshot all of an account's weeks and assignments.
Recovery codes are hashed per user and shown only once. A format-3 export can copy weeks,
assignments, preferences and routines onto another account after a preview. Recorded `operation_id`
values make a retried write return the first result.

## Non-Obvious Decisions
- The engine core is pure: Python reads the clock, environment, files and randomness and passes
  them in. JSON text crosses the boundary (a 12-block week costs about 0.02 ms to encode and decode).
- `serde_json` has `preserve_order` on, and `engine/clippy.toml` forbids the removes that reorder
  keys, so stored JSON keeps Python's key order.
- Colour maths calls the C library's `cbrt`, `pow`, `atan2`, `sin` and `cos`, looked up at run time
  (`desk/cmath.rs`: `libm.so.6`, `ucrtbase.dll` on Windows), so results match Python's to the bit.
- Case folding uses a table generated from this interpreter (`engine/tools/generate_casefold.py`),
  not a crate.
- The engine crate builds at opt-level 2 in debug so the solver's 150 ms budget holds under load
  (Jonathan's choice).
- A week's identity is its Monday. Blocks store a day index and derive their date. `weeks` pins the
  ISO shape before parsing, because `date.fromisoformat` also accepts "20260907" and "2026-W37-1".
- GET /api/week 422s a non-Monday rather than snapping it, so client and server cannot disagree about
  which week is open.
- The identical-blocks short-circuit runs before the revision check, as the pre-dated code did.
- The migration is guarded on the weeks table existing and runs in an explicit BEGIN IMMEDIATE.
  Registration seeds no weeks row; a missing row already means an empty week.
- A new flexible task in the week on screen may use today onward, since the solver does not know
  today's date. The dialog offers Fixed or Flexible only for a new item; editing keeps the kind.
- The desktop app bundles the backend and runs it in-process (owner's choice 2026-09-07). The
  loopback port is chosen by binding a socket before `create_app`, because the backend pins its CSRF
  origin check and TrustedHostMiddleware to one origin; uvicorn gets the bound socket and runs with
  `loop="asyncio"`, `http="h11"`.
- An invalid FLEXWEEK_*_ORIGIN is an error, not a fall back to local, so a typo cannot quietly open
  a different, empty database.
- `profile_root()` reads QStandardPaths AppDataLocation, so `main()` sets the application name first.
- Nuitka is called directly, since `pyside6-deploy` rewrites its spec with machine paths.
- `theme` is `system|slate|nocturne` (default `system`, owner decision 2026-09-10).
  `allow_system_theme()` rebuilds an older preferences table once, keeping stored slate/nocturne.
- The accent stays at least CIE76 distance 15 from every category colour; a test in
  `desktop/tests/test_look.py` holds it.
- Windows installers: the Inno `AppId` and the MSI `UpgradeCode` are fixed forever so upgrades find
  the installed copy. The .exe is per account, the .msi per machine. Inno Setup 7.1.0 is downloaded in
  CI with its SHA-256 checked; WiX is pinned to 6.0.2 because v7 blocks on an EULA. Windows ICU is
  required from Windows 10 1809 rather than copied out of System32.
- Linux leads with a tar.gz so the executable bit survives. The AppImage needs FUSE; without it use
  `--appimage-extract` then `squashfs-root/AppRun`, or the tarball.
- The smoke test decides a week was drawn by counting colours in a grab of the window
  (`PAINTED_MIN_COLORS`, 8 px grid): a blank window is one flat colour.
- The release workflow stops a Windows installer or smoke test that hangs after ten minutes.

## Session Handoff
- 2026-10-10, `release/0.19.1`: J19 (a GPT-6 Luna lane, reviewed and fixed by Claude), the Retro
  Large-text window height and Month at 1024x640, on Jonathan's full go for 0.19.1 (push, PR, merge,
  release). Kept as they are, his to revisit: "12:00 AM" for the end of the day on the 12-hour clock,
  the shorter sign-in reset note, a whole series' typed start in the past allowed, the stacked dated
  day chips. A Grok audit of 0.19.0 is running on his side.
- Next: 1.0.0 with the Android companion (Rust core via UniFFI, Kotlin and Compose) and iroh device
  sync with background sync on the phone (about Oct 22); plan in
  `~/.flexweek-ui-harness/scratch/PLAN-0185-to-100.md`.
